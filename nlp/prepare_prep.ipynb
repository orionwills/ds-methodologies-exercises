       "  'original': '\\nJust a few months before starting at Codeup in the Redwood cohort, I was sitting in the football stadium at the University of Colorado at Boulder, pondering what I would do after graduation. The commencement speaker that year was Kate Fagan, a sports reporter and commentator at ESPN. In her speech, something she said stuck out to me: “Try replacing ‘should’ with ‘want’ and, as frequently as you are able, make decisions with that rubric. Life is best when your ‘should’ and your ‘want’ are aligned.” Sitting there in that stadium, I realized that I knew exactly what I should be doing after graduating, which was applying to attend graduate school for the next five years. But the actual truth was, I didn’t know what I truly wanted. Did I really want to jump into something for five years that I wasn’t completely sure about? \\nWith this in mind I moved to San Antonio after graduation, mostly to be closer to my family. One night at the dinner table, my brother-in-law mentioned several eye-catching billboards around town promoting a local coding bootcamp named Codeup. I had dabbled a bit in coding when I was in college, so my interest was immediately piqued. However, there were doubts nagging at the back of my mind. Am I even capable enough to attend an intensive coding bootcamp like this? I’m not really a super logical person… Am I cut out for this? etc, etc. Despite having a ton of reservations about my capabilities and the usefulness of attending a boot camp, I decided to take a leap of faith. And just a year-and-a-half later, I celebrated my one year as a software developer at Armor in Richardson, TX. In some ways, it feels like a dream. The hard work I put in, the days and nights of impassioned coding, pushing through all the excuses… and finally landing a dream job?! It’s a colorful blur. \\nSo that’s why in this post, I want to address five common excuses that may be keeping you from considering a career in technology. At the end of the day, it doesn’t really make sense to let your fears and nagging doubts keep you from the job of your dreams.\\n1. “I’m not cut out for a career in tech”\\n\\nThis was one of the primary fears at the forefront of my mind when thinking about doing a complete shift to a technology career. And, as I went through Codeup, I heard this many times from my peers. To be honest, it doesn’t ever fully go away. There are days even now at work where I think I’m in over my head and that I don’t belong there (Imposter Syndrome, anyone?). This fear completely disregards the fact that I’m already doing it. The truth is, it isn’t always easy. Technology is constantly changing, creating new problems and forcing those within the field to continuously find new solutions. At my company, even our most senior developers are learning something new every day. We all have our doubts sometimes, but those self-limiting beliefs shouldn’t keep you from pursuing anything you set your mind to. \\n2. “I wouldn’t fit in with engineers”\\n\\nLet me ask you something. What does a veteran, electrical technician, and college music teacher have in common? Well, there was at least one of each in my cohort at Codeup, and all of them excelled and went on to become software developers. Other characters in my cohort included a stay-at-home-mom, barista, marketing professional, and a chef. All of these, however, are just arbitrary labels. None of these people told themselves “I’m just going to be a barista forever, because that’s who I am” or “My personality only suits being in a teacher, so I’m not going to try something different.” The reality is, our self-concept is always constantly shifting. There was such a colorful diversity of backgrounds, personalities, and skill sets at Codeup, proving that there’s no one type or mold of individual that can pursue a technology career. \\n3. “I don’t want to work alone all day staring at a computer screen”\\n\\nThere are days where indeed this is the case for me, just “heads down coding”, but more often than not my days are filled with collaboration and communication with my teammates. When someone runs into a problem they don’t have the knowledge to solve, they track down someone who does. When a few of us are working in the same codebase, we make sure to frequently communicate to make sure we’re not stepping on each other’s toes. On top of that, we get to be a part of producing the product, providing feedback and suggestions. There are very few days where I just sit at my desk all day, boring holes into my computer screen. Although my experience may certainly be atypical, the main point I’m trying to make is that there is a large range of positions and cultures within the technology field. There are also other roles within the technology field beyond coding and data analytics, such as evangelists and solutions consultants. Both of these have lots of interaction with people and clients! Don’t be afraid to try a few different things until you find your fit.\\n4. “I don’t have enough experience”\\n\\nMost of us at Codeup did not come in with prior experience in coding. The great thing about coding bootcamps is that they typically take you from 0 to 100 in a condensed period of time. They guide you through the entire process, allowing you to maximize your success, with everything from technical skills, networking, portfolio-building, and resume review. Even with bootcamps aside, there is a plethora of both paid and free resources online that give you the ability to learn a lot of the preliminary skills you would need. There are communities (e.g. Chingu) with the sole purpose of learning and building projects in new technologies. Experience can be gained, so seek out those resources. They’re only a few keystrokes away. \\nOne thing to note about the technology field is that it’s becoming more and more heavily based on experience and not your formal education. Many companies will see the value in someone who has practical experience. The reality is that many companies are shifting towards seeking out individuals that can come in and hit the ground running with practical know-how instead of purely theoretical education. \\n5. “I’m not tech savvy enough.”\\n\\nAlthough basic computer skills are necessary for success, it’s probably not as much as you think. And like I mentioned above, being able to excel in this field is all about embracing change and learning to learn. You may think you’re not tech savvy because you always have issues with your radio or you can’t get your apps to work right or you get frustrated with your computer software for not doing what you want it to – all of these things are valid struggles. Trust me, I’ve been there. The reality is this: Many of these skills can be learned.\\n\\nAs you look into pursuing a career in the technology field, don’t let these thought patterns keep you from getting where you want to be. Instead, ask yourself the real questions: Why do I want to do this? What kind of lifestyle do I see for myself? What am I passionate about? Excuses are excuses, not truths about you and your life. Set a vision and relentlessly pursue it, letting all these limiting beliefs slide off of you. They don’t have to define your journey.\\n\\n\\nJoyce Ling is a software developer at a cloud security company based in Richardson, TX.

       "  'original': '\\nBefore moving to San Antonio, I was slightly apprehensive. Knowing little to nothing about the city, I didn’t know what to expect. All that had filtered down from the collective consciousness to my perception of the city was the obvious tourist attractions such as the Riverwalk, Alamo, and amazing Tex Mex. After spending a little under a year there, I came to fall in love with this city for reasons beyond what tourists can see in a weekend. The experience of its vibrant and proud Latino culture, flourishing art scene, and emphasis on community have left an indelible mark upon my life. \\nAll this aside, a huge part of my experience in San Antonio was attending Codeup, a coding boot camp that allowed me to have the skills needed to make a complete career shift and also an insider’s look into San Antonio’s flourishing tech community. For those of you that have never had a local’s perspective into the technology layer of San Antonio, I’m here to explain five reasons you should consider beginning a data science career here.\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa01. San Antonio is a tech hotspot.\\nAlthough San Antonio is usually overshadowed by its northern neighbor Austin, it is actually a humble but bustling tech hotspot according to Inc., a weekly business magazine. Especially as Austin’s infrastructure struggles to support its rapid expansion and population growth, corporations and talent have begun to siphon off to San Antonio, which is only an hour south. Cost-of-living is much lower compared to Austin and is an attractive option for anyone starting out in entry-level data science. Additionally, a 2018 CBRE report names San Antonio in the top 50 US markets for tech talent, and is rapidly rising. On top of that, San Antonio ranked first among small tech markets in millennial population growth, with 12.5 percent between 2011 and 2016. Brookings found even greater growth, more than 14 percent, among millennials in a January report. Where the talent goes, corporations will follow. \\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\xa0\\xa02.

       "  'original': '\\nYou come home from work, tired to the bone and groaning as you realize you forgot to prep dinner tonight. So, what do you do? You plop down on the couch, whip out your phone and Google “restaurants near me”. You scroll down the list of places to eat and take into account a variety of factors: how high the ratings are, how many people have rated that restaurant, how far it is from you, whether or not it’s busy at that moment, the keywords mentioned in reviews, how long it’s open… the list goes on. You carefully bookmark each prospective restaurant so you can find it later. All of a sudden, you notice that without your knowledge, three hours have slipped by. You realize with a feeling of dread in your stomach that nearly all the restaurants around you are closed… and you head over to the nearest Whataburger in defeat. \\nA week later, life finds you in the same supine position on the couch, scrolling through restaurants. This time, though, you realize there’s a little compatibility rating next to each restaurant listing. As you scroll, you stumble upon a sushi restaurant that apparently is 90% compatible with your preferences. Without hesitation, you rush there with glee to find that it is everything you could have hoped for! Wow! Data science saves the day!\\n\\nThis very relatable experience is a prime example of how many of us have experienced data science in our lives without realizing it. Let’s take a quick moment to analyze how data science played the protagonist in this story. It is important to note that data science is a broad subject that encompasses a variety of things, including first gathering and shaping data, storing that data, then analyzing and visually presenting that data. \\n\\xa0\\nHow Google Does It\\nBefore we can start analyzing data, Google data scientists must first be able to gather information about everything from restaurant locations, hours, pricing, customer reviews, etc. Next, this massive influx of data must be efficiently manipulated and organized so it can quickly be retrieved, Marie Kondo style. Data scientists are then able to take and analyze this data and visually translate it into something that makes sense, such as the graph that displays the busiest hours at the restaurant, or the tidy list of restaurants you see in the app that is ordered by distance from you.\\n\\nA simple action such as filtering by “Open Now” or “Price” requires a tight coordination of all of these steps in order to actually produce the output expected by the user. Amazingly, Google Maps is able to do this analysis real-time to constantly change its results based on your current location. Not only that, it is simultaneously analyzing every single person’s GPS data real-time. This allows them to generate components like the graph of how busy an establishment is at the moment.\\n\\xa0\\nGoogle Maps, A Man’s Best Friend\\nAnother important factor in data science is using analysis to drive predictions (Read more here about the difference between data analytics and data science). For example, in calculating compatibility ratings, the program takes into account Google location history, search history, types of cuisine/restaurants you typically visit or avoid, whether you’ve saved/rated/visited a place or somewhere similar, or simply data that a user inputs about their dietary preferences. It also allows for constant feedback from the user if a compatibility rating seems off, with a “Not Right?” link attached to every rating. In other words, this rating is a prediction of how much you would like a restaurant based on your past history and behavior. \\nSo how exactly has Google mastered this compatibility rating? Most likely, data scientists at Google have created algorithms to take the pieces of information listed above to produce a prediction. Essentially, it’s a way for a computer program to act more human. For example, think about how you recommend a show to your best friend. Most likely, you know your friend’s personality and history of shows that they’ve enjoyed, so you generally know what kind of show they may like watching. \\nSimilarly, data scientists can use algorithms and statistical models to write code that continuously “learns” to make better predictions, creating an adaptable learning machine. With machine learning and artificial intelligence, Google is able to generate friendly human-like recommendations for over a billion people every single month, which is probably better than what your best friend could do.\\n\\n\\nWhen Robots Take Over the World\\nAs the data science field continues to progress and we get closer and closer to true artificial intelligence, we will most likely see the effects of that trickle down into the parts of our everyday life that we hardly consider. We already trust the algorithms and generated recommendations that suggest where or when to eat. Eventually, even something as vital as a life-altering surgery will be dictated by recommendations generated by algorithms for doctors. Understanding and learning about data science will become more significant as it gradually becomes enmeshed with society in ways we may not even be able to fully comprehend. Read more here about Codeup’s 18-week Data Science program which covers most of the topics mentioned in this article, including data visualization, analytics, and machine learning. \\n—\\n\\nJoyce Ling is a software developer at a cloud security company based in Richardson, TX.

Data scientist are then able to take and analyze this data and visually translate it into something that make sense, such a the graph that display the busiest hour at the restaurant, or the tidy list of restaurant you see in the app that is ordered by distance from you. A simple action such a filtering by “Open Now” or “Price” requires a tight coordination of all of these step in order to actually produce the output expected by the user. Amazingly, Google Maps is able to do this analysis real-time to constantly change it result based on your current location. Not only that, it is simultaneously analyzing every single person’s GPS data real-time. This allows them to generate component like the graph of how busy an establishment is at the moment. Google Maps, A Man’s Best Friend Another important factor in data science is using analysis to drive prediction (Read more here about the difference between data analytics and data science). For example, in calculating compatibility ratings, the program take into account Google location history, search history, type of cuisine/restaurants you typically visit or avoid, whether you’ve saved/rated/visited a place or somewhere similar, or simply data that a user input about their dietary preferences. It also allows for constant feedback from the user if a compatibility rating seems off, with a “Not Right?” link attached to every rating. In other words, this rating is a prediction of how much you would like a restaurant based on your past history and behavior. So how exactly ha Google mastered this compatibility rating? Most likely, data scientist at Google have created algorithm to take the piece of information listed above to produce a prediction. Essentially, it’s a way for a computer program to act more human. For example, think about how you recommend a show to your best friend. Most likely, you know your friend’s personality and history of show that they’ve enjoyed, so you generally know what kind of show they may like watching. Similarly, data scientist can use algorithm and statistical model to write code that continuously “learns” to make better predictions, creating an adaptable learning machine. With machine learning and artificial intelligence, Google is able to generate friendly human-like recommendation for over a billion people every single month, which is probably better than what your best friend could do. When Robots Take Over the World As the data science field continues to progress and we get closer and closer to true artificial intelligence, we will most likely see the effect of that trickle down into the part of our everyday life that we hardly consider. We already trust the algorithm and generated recommendation that suggest where or when to eat. Eventually, even something a vital a a life-altering surgery will be dictated by recommendation generated by algorithm for doctors. Understanding and learning about data science will become more significant a it gradually becomes enmeshed with society in way we may not even be able to fully comprehend.

       "  'original': '\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBy Marcella Munter\\nI looked at Codeup for 2 years before I finally made the decision to apply. As a requirement for my Math degree, I took an Intro to Java class. I enjoyed it so much and was tempted to switch majors. However, I was a semester away from graduation and decided not to. Coding was still something I wanted to do so I tried some online courses. \\nThe online classes were satisfactory, but it made me realize two things: 1) I didn’t know what I needed to be learning and 2) whatever I did learn, I needed to be in a classroom setting to learn it. I heard about Codeup and other coding bootcamps and added myself to Codeup’s mailing list. However, both the price and the thought of having to quit my job scared me from ever applying. I found a cheaper coding school and attended one of their coding workshops, but didn’t like the way the workshop was run. The instructors only gave us lines of code to write with little theory behind it. That combined with poor organization in general made me realize that was not the place for me. I went back to Codeup’s website and read about their curriculum. I liked how theory as well as practical usage was taught. I was also liked seeing how much help was available to students from instructors and student fellows. However, the biggest question still on my mind was, “Will I get a job afterwards?”\\nI learned that the curriculum at Codeup is developed with input from tech companies, which means that Codeup is teaching important skills that employers are actually looking for. Incidentally, the curriculum changed a bit a few months before I started due to employers’ requests. An added bonus on the job front was an in-house liaison between students and employers. Codeup’s Director of Product, Stephen Salas, has connections with several companies and he always know which ones are looking for developers fresh out of school. I decided to take a chance and applied even though I was still worried about the financial part of it. When I got accepted, I found out that there are many scholarships and programs to help ease the financial burden. I qualified for some of these even though I thought I wouldn’t. Many more scholarships and grants have been added since I left Codeup thus lowering the barrier to attend. I graduated in May 2018 and am currently working as a developer specializing in data extraction and transformation. I love what I’m doing now. My only regret is that I didn’t do this sooner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nJoin Us_ \\n\\nWe\\'re excited to launch our new Codeup newsletter, which highlights some interesting blog posts, things in the know, and upcoming events.

       "  'original': '\\nPhoto by Jon Garcia\\nCodeup welcomed the Wrangell cohort on July 23. With the start of this cohort, we launched a new blog series: the Codeup Student Check In. We’ll interview a student over the course of the 4.5 months to see how things are progressing from first impressions all the way to graduation. Thus, welcome to the Codeup Student Check In: Month 3!\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nCodeup: How has your experience been at Codeup so far? \\nWrangell Student: I’ve had a great experience so far. Everything has been what I imagined and more. I have learned things in a short amount of time that otherwise would’ve taken me months upon months to learn. The people here are some of the kindest and most supportive people that I’ve met in a long time, and I’m happy to have this experience in my life. \\nC: Describe what you’re learning right now. Is it hard/fun/challenging? \\nS: We’ve just started our capstone project which is the final hurrah of our Codeup experience. We are in the planning stages and it’s honestly a little overwhelming due to the sheer amount of information we’re communicating to our teammates and because of the volume of work that’s going to be done over this next week or two. Nonetheless, I am excited by the challenge and I know that our final project is going to be something that I will be really proud of and really happy to have been a part of. I’m excited to see how it will all pan out. \\nC: How has the learning process/information gathering been?\\nS: I love doing research and the focus of my research has shifted from solely academic to a balance between academic and professional. I am still researching new technologies as well as doing further research into the current curriculum but now I am also doing research into potential companies I’d like to work with. I’m interested in their mission and if their goals align with mine, both short and long term.\\nC:What has been the most memorable part of this month?\\nS:The most memorable part of this month has been actually shopping for new interview outfits, looking at myself in the mirror, and seeing a young professional. This has been one of my long-term goals and it’s a great experience seeing it come to fruition.\\nC:How do you feel your skill level compares to last month? \\nS: I think my skill levels are increasing each month. Now that we are going into full stack applications I can finally see the cumulative success of my time here.\\nC: How have the instructors and staff been helpful? Have you started working with the placement side of Codeup? If so, can you elaborate on that? \\nS: I am grateful for the mock interview process with the instructors. It’s really helpful to have your instructors grade you on your performance and prep you for real world interviews. These instructors all have some sort of practical experience and firsthand knowledge of the professional world. Their experience and advice is invaluable.\\nC: Did you learn anything new at Codeup that you weren’t expecting? \\nS: I wasn’t expecting to learn as many people skills as I did. I thought this was strictly a technical school and this really came as a surprise. I have really learned how to network and how to talk to people that I otherwise would have been scared to talk to. I’ve learned that people are people, just humans, and improving conversational skills to talk with them is valuable. Learning the value of a human connection in the professional world is a very exciting thing.\\nC: Have you been interviewing for jobs? What has that been like? If not, do you know what type of role you are looking for? (Ie. Developer, Q/A, Tech sales, Tech Ed, etc)\\nS: I’ve had a few interviews this weekend and they have been very exciting and stressful. Having interviews back to back is both a blessing and a curse. It’s important to destress at home and really be aware of your emotions and reactions to stress. Time management is another big challenge. How much time do I put into studying versus interview prep? How much time can I dedicate to other life roles and be a good girlfriend, good daughter, and good pet owner while still fulfilling my role as a student and job seeker? These challenges are tough to overcome, and this is where emotional awareness can really help.\\nC: If you can give one piece of advice to any prospective students, what would it be? \\nS: Really do your research. Know what you’re getting into. You can’t go into anything blind! Get as much knowledge as you can so you can thoroughly prepare for and enjoy this journey. A great plan will save you a lot of suffering in the long run.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nJoin Us_ \\n\\nWe\\'re excited to launch our new Codeup newsletter, which highlights some interesting blog posts, things in the know, and upcoming events.

As a child, I took all my electronic toys apart, because I was curious what was inside. So you can say, I always yearned for a career in tech.\\nMy name is Sukari Schutzman. I don’t take myself too seriously, I’m always laughing, and trying to share positive energy, but most importantly I am a software developer.\\nWhen I got my cosmetology license, I was passionate about doing hair. I wanted to learn how to be better, and how to perfect my craft. In many ways, I see a lot of parallels in cosmetology, and in software development. Drawing those parallels kept me strong in the program and reminded me to never give up. I remembered when I was in cosmetology school, or when I was in the salon and I was stuck on something, I always asked for help. In software development and at Codeup, the same rings true.\\nI had always driven by the billboards on I-10 on my way into San Antonio and was ALWAYS confused. “Software Developer? Why is ‘Retail Manager’ crossed out? What is that?”, I always wondered. But I always continued to drive on and thought nothing of it when I reached my destination.\\nI decided development was for me and wanted to transition into it and learn how to code, as I had been exposed to it for a while. I knew self-study would not work for me. I needed to be in a classroom and knew I needed to be in front of an instructor. But most importantly, I needed a job ASAP because I needed to support myself and my child.\\nWhen I arrived at Codeup and went on the tour I was amazed. I knew this would be the place for me, and it was going to be where I knew my life would change. I was going to be walking out of one door and into another. And I wasn’t going to look back.\\nWhen I found out that I had got in, I was so happy that my hard work paid off and I knew it was just the beginning of what was to come. I looked forward to the start date and marked it on my calendar. I also quit my job, which was much needed because salon life was stressful enough, let alone learning a new skill.\\nThe next few months were filled with triumphs and failures, which is normal in any career. No one is born good at everything, it takes practice and determination (I totally had to repeat that to myself every single day at Codeup. Thanks Ryan!). Sometimes it felt like two steps back, but I was determined to make it to Demo Day and present my Capstone.\\nWith the help of Codeup staff, I felt setup to succeed at Demo Day. But most of all, I felt prepared for my new career.\\nDemo Day finally came! Our project got the most compliments on the visual interface, which I worked hard on, and helped us stand out amongst our classmates. I had a few interviews set up for within a week after Demo Day and landed my first job. At this point, I was in awe. Everything I worked hard for had finally came to fruition. And most of all, I didn’t have to work weekends unless I wanted to.\\n\\nThere’s nothing wrong with being hair stylist, absolutely not! However, it just wasn’t for me anymore.

       "  'original': '\\nby Alexander Bous\\n\\nGrowing up\\nIt would be an understatement to say that the bar of expectations were set high as the youngest of 4 to immigrant parents, who were also mechanical engineers. Eldest: Entrepreneur with several successful businesses; Second: Contract Law Lawyer; Third: Doctor of Neonatal Genetics; Fourth (Me): cooked since I was 15. Although the decision to make a career of cooking didn’t hit me for a few years, I had known that I did not want to follow the footsteps of my parents or siblings.\\nCooking\\nAt the age of 19, I decided that I wanted to attend college at the prestigious Culinary Institute of America (CIA). Before I could finalize my decision, I knew I had to tell my parents. They reacted just as I thought they would. “What?! NO, NEVER! Never in my life did I ever think my son would become a cook.” Our family comes from a culture where there are three acceptable career paths: Doctors, Lawyers, and Engineers. Coming from a family where I already had a sibling fulfilling each of those roles, I felt that I had nothing to prove to anyone except myself. I ended up attending CIA and working in the industry for 15 years. Having held every role in a kitchen and marriage, including being a parent, I decided it was time to put my ego aside, think about what’s best for my family, and transition careers.\\nThe Most Important Thing\\nEarly on in my cooking career, I had a mentor that drilled a simple phrase into my head: “The most important thing in life is to figure out what is most important.” This simple saying spoke very loudly to me; how can you work towards a goal if you don’t know what the goal is? Every task I would work on in life would ring those words in my head; So what was most important to me? “A happy family and nothing else” is what I have defined as what is most important. Now it’s time to figure out how to get there.\\nThe First Step: Codeup Open House\\nAfter spending too much time on autopilot, it was then that I realized the only thing keeping me in the restaurant industry was that it was the only thing I really knew. I needed to break the mold to be able to achieve the most important thing. Having always been computer savvy and a self-proclaimed problem solver, I soon realized that I was better with computers than I thought. It seemed to come more naturally to me than others, which was when I realized I needed to find a career that would allow me to use my skills in computers. There was only one clear answer for me, and that was Codeup. I spent time at their open house, and I was sold. Not only were they kind and caring individuals, but also extremely smart and talented developers and teachers. It seemed like the right answer.\\nThe Second Step: “Good”\\nAfter getting through the admissions process and getting accepted, I decided to make the best of my decision to attend and set a plan of action to take in as much as possible. I made note cards, studied ahead, built random projects I found online, and ran code kata’s everyday. Sounds impressive, but I can assure you, there was much failure involved. If I was struggling, “Good” would tend to be my response because with failure comes the opportunity to get better; it meant that there was something that I needed to work on. As the difficulty level strengthened, so did the number of “Good” moments. There were moments when doubt and worry went through my mind as well. I was worried that I had made the wrong move. \\xa0I turned to my classmates with the plea for help, they responded similarly as well. “What a relief,” I thought. It was good to know that I wasn’t the only one in class struggling because it made me realized I tricked myself into thinking that I was couldn’t do it. \\nFinding a Job with Only Cooking Experience\\nAfter graduating from Codeup and being fully aware of my imposter syndrome, I could not shake the thought of why someone would hire me. I would have to constantly remind myself that, with the skills I had from my previous work experiences and the new skills I learned over the past 18 weeks, I was more than capable. With the help of the Director of Product, Stephen Salas, I was able to find a job within one week of graduating.\\nGoal Achieved: Now What? Maintain and Gain Skills\\nI got the knowledge, got the job, and got the work/life balance. Now what? Now it’s time to continue to learn and advance with your newly learned skills. One thing I realized after going through the Codeup program was that there are a lot of similarities between learning to code and learning to cook. At first, basic skills require a lot of effort and struggle, but eventually they become second nature. After the basics are understood and the muscle memory is built, then comes the never ending list of more advanced skills. When people ask me what the best part of Codeup is, I tend to respond simply with, “they taught me how to learn”. I look at new projects that I am given and when I have no idea where to start, I say “Good”, another opportunity to get better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nJoin Us_ \\n\\nWe\\'re excited to launch our new Codeup newsletter, which highlights some interesting blog posts, things in the know, and upcoming events.

There wa only one clear answer for me, and that wa Codeup. I spent time at their open house, and I wa sold. Not only were they kind and caring individuals, but also extremely smart and talented developer and teachers. It seemed like the right answer. The Second Step: “Good” After getting through the admission process and getting accepted, I decided to make the best of my decision to attend and set a plan of action to take in a much a possible. I made note cards, studied ahead, built random project I found online, and ran code kata’s everyday. Sounds impressive, but I can assure you, there wa much failure involved. If I wa struggling, “Good” would tend to be my response because with failure come the opportunity to get better; it meant that there wa something that I needed to work on. As the difficulty level strengthened, so did the number of “Good” moments. There were moment when doubt and worry went through my mind a well. I wa worried that I had made the wrong move. I turned to my classmate with the plea for help, they responded similarly a well. “What a relief,” I thought. It wa good to know that I wasn’t the only one in class struggling because it made me realized I tricked myself into thinking that I wa couldn’t do it. Finding a Job with Only Cooking Experience After graduating from Codeup and being fully aware of my imposter syndrome, I could not shake the thought of why someone would hire me. I would have to constantly remind myself that, with the skill I had from my previous work experience and the new skill I learned over the past 18 weeks, I wa more than capable. With the help of the Director of Product, Stephen Salas, I wa able to find a job within one week of graduating. Goal Achieved: Now What? Maintain and Gain Skills I got the knowledge, got the job, and got the work/life balance. Now what? Now it’s time to continue to learn and advance with your newly learned skills. One thing I realized after going through the Codeup program wa that there are a lot of similarity between learning to code and learning to cook. At first, basic skill require a lot of effort and struggle, but eventually they become second nature. After the basic are understood and the muscle memory is built, then come the never ending list of more advanced skills. When people ask me what the best part of Codeup is, I tend to respond simply with, “they taught me how to learn”. I look at new project that I am given and when I have no idea where to start, I say “Good”, another opportunity to get better.

       "  'original': '\\n\\xa0\\nWhen you’re scared to run your code, and it works the first try (Halloween style)!\\n\\nWhen I first started as a developer I ran into some scary scenarios. My code was very error prone and I created some functions that I was expecting a string as the output but I got an object. It was very frustrating and I wasn’t even sure I would be able to understand software development let alone have to go and fix my code. My nightmare scenario was to be hired on as a developer and then have to troubleshoot, a.k.a. debug, some other developers code😱😱😱. I think most junior developers have had shared my fear at some point in their career. I was taught to heavily rely upon outputting your results to the console whether its good or bad to help troubleshoot.\\nIn this post I will do my best to help calm the fears of my fellow junior developers with helpful debugging tools and hopefully transition away from relying upon\\xa0console.log(). While my focus will be on JavaScript these tools can easily be translated to other languages.\\nLogging output to the console isn’t always\\xa0helpful\\nFor the longest time\\xa0console.log()\\xa0was my go-to when I needed to debug JavaScript code. It was my developer friend who told me what was wrong with my code and was never judgemental\\xa0. I will admit that there are few scenarios where it is “OK” to output the results of a function to the console.\\nExcept more recently, I have found using\\xa0console.log()\\xa0to be less useful when debugging\\xa0and only making things worse by expecting a good outcome and then disappointing me. Like an expired $5 Amazon Gift Card (Thanks, grandma). Take for example, this gem:\\nObject doesn\\'t support property or method \\'from\\'\\nThat lovely error is from IE 11 which does not support Array.from(node List) prototype without a shim/poly fill that is available\\xa0here.\\nHowever, I have come to find out that logging errors to the console is either inefficient or completely irrelevant to what may actually be causing the problem in your code. I will admit that some errors are easily resolved by reading the output of the error message and fixing the typo or following the instructions of the error message to help resolve the problem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo in the image above we are shown a node item which has so many properties that you might not be aware of, which renders console.log useless. You have to know ahead of time what value or specific attribute you are trying to output which requires some abstract thinking or referencing documentation to identify this property. Now using the console.log will output all the entire properties of the node item but its an unnecessary step to add in this line of code while you debug and then go back and remove the line of code.\\n\\n“You don’t know what you don’t know” -Bill Parcel (Head Coach New England Patriots)\\n\\nThe error the console outputs might provide you with the location of the error, but you may not know why are you getting the error in the first place. Maybe you’re passing the incorrect value to the function or you are working with event handling and\\xa0bubbling events.\\nEither way, chances are that you aren’t thinking about that one property that is actually passing the value your expecting because you weren’t aware of how to call it or pass it along.\\nI’m going to piggy back off of\\xa0Mozilla’s Debug Playground\\xa0as an example for why you shouldn’t use the console and instead use the Browsers built-in debugger or equally as helpful is an IDE’s built-in debugger.\\ncough cough\\xa0Visual Studio Code\\xa0cough cough\\n\\xa0Now, whether you prefer Chrome over FireFox is a whole different can-o-worms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIDE Tools and Online\\xa0REPLs\\n\\n“Hey man, I’m a back-end developer and so I need to console.log”\\n-Fictional Backend Developer\\n\\nSo maybe you don’t have a fully fleshed out web form or you’re trying to get data from some API or JSON file. You need to see data from the function you’re writing or better yet you want to test a function that someone else wrote without having to clone the entire project. Using\\xa0console.log()\\xa0seems like the go to. In fact,\\xa0around ¾ of Node.js developers report using it\\xa0(in 2017) for finding errors in their applications.\\nI’m here to tell you of a few better ways to debug your code.\\nIDE Tools\\nThe first tool I have come to love and trust is one made by a company called\\xa0Wallaby.js\\nQuokkaJS (Integrated Scratchpad for JavaScript)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith this plug-in you can write your code and get immediate results. No need to throw in a bunch of console.log’s in your function and check the output. It has an integration for\\xa0VSCode\\xa0(💖💖💖 ),\\xa0JetBrainsIDE\\xa0and\\xa0Atom. I personally have purchased a pro license but for the most part the community version will work just fine.\\nSonarLint\\xa0( Like spellcheck but for your code)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI think all developers should have some sort of code linting tool added into their IDE. This helps review your code in real-time and “should” prevent you from compiling or running code with errors in it. I’ve chosen SonarLint because its given me better results than ES6 linter or some other linting tools that i’ve tried. I’m not saying its the best or that the others don’t work but I haven’t had to configure much other than just installing the extension.\\nScratchpad (Built-in Browser Javascript sandbox)\\nMozilla also offers a feature in their\\xa0DevTools\\xa0that allows you to write, run, and view the output of JavaScript code that can interact with the current web page or not.\\nREPLs\\nI have a background in\\xa0.NET development and I have fallen in love with\\xa0Microsoft’s F# Language\\xa0along with the\\xa0fsharp community. While going through the documentation I was introduced to a new term, REPL.\\nREPL stands for:\\xa0Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop.\\n“ In a REPL, the user enters one or more expressions (rather than an entire\\xa0compilation unit) and the REPL evaluates them and displays the results.” -Wikipedia\\nSo I thought, this was cool and I used my Googliness™️ to search for an online version or service and so I came upon THIS.\\n\\nREPL.IT\\n\\nI don’t need to console.log my output or assign the function to\\xa0var result = greeting()\\xa0and then\\xa0console.log(greeting(\"Jessica\"))\\xa0. I just write my function, invoke it and BOOM! I get the output without the need of\\xa0console.log()\\xa0.\\n\\nRepl.it supports many languages!\\n\\n\\nI can even create a Repl, write some code and share the link with someone that can give me feedback, Brilliant!\\nCoincidentally, Repl.it uses\\xa0Monaco, which is the same Editor that VSCode uses.\\nFinally, for the developer on a budget (including myself) most popular IDEs have a built-in debugger that works the same was as the debugger in Chrome or Firefox.\\nI’ve kindly added links to How-Tos: For a few IDEs (don’t get mad if your IDE is not listed, I’m looking at you Atom IDE community).\\nDebugging in VSCode\\xa0\\nDebugging in JetBrains IntelliJ\\nDebugging in Visual Studio\\nFinal Thoughts\\nSo why have I gone through the long winded trouble of explaining / trying to convince you why you should wean yourself off of using the console.log and embrace debugging tools? How was this suppose to make you feel better / more confident in writing code?\\nThe short answer is:\\xa0I believe having more information and proper tools “should” make coding, and for that matter debugging, less daunting / scary.\\nUse of widely available, open-source debugging tools is key to be more familiar with software development and to grow as a developer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nJoin Us_ \\n\\nWe\\'re excited to launch our new Codeup newsletter, which highlights some interesting blog posts, things in the know, and upcoming events.

So in the imag abov we are shown a node item which ha so mani properti that you might not be awar of, which render console.log useless. you have to know ahead of time what valu or specif attribut you are tri to output which requir some abstract think or referenc document to identifi thi property. now use the console.log will output all the entir properti of the node item but it an unnecessari step to add in thi line of code while you debug and then go back and remov the line of code. “you don’t know what you don’t know” -bill parcel (head coach new england patriots) the error the consol output might provid you with the locat of the error, but you may not know whi are you get the error in the first place. mayb you’r pass the incorrect valu to the function or you are work with event handl and bubbl events. either way, chanc are that you aren’t think about that one properti that is actual pass the valu your expect becaus you weren’t awar of how to call it or pass it along. i’m go to piggi back off of mozilla’ debug playground as an exampl for whi you shouldn’t use the consol and instead use the browser built-in debugg or equal as help is an ide’ built-in debugger. cough cough visual studio code cough cough now, whether you prefer chrome over firefox is a whole differ can-o-worms. ide tool and onlin repl “hey man, i’m a back-end develop and so I need to console.log” -fiction backend develop So mayb you don’t have a fulli flesh out web form or you’r tri to get data from some api or json file. you need to see data from the function you’r write or better yet you want to test a function that someon els wrote without have to clone the entir project. use console.log() seem like the go to. In fact, around ¾ of node.j develop report use it (in 2017) for find error in their applications. i’m here to tell you of a few better way to debug your code. ide tool the first tool I have come to love and trust is one made by a compani call wallaby.j quokkaj (integr scratchpad for javascript) with thi plug-in you can write your code and get immedi results. No need to throw in a bunch of console.log’ in your function and check the output. It ha an integr for vscode (💖💖💖 ), jetbrainsid and atom. I person have purchas a pro licens but for the most part the commun version will work just fine. sonarlint ( like spellcheck but for your code) I think all develop should have some sort of code lint tool ad into their ide. thi help review your code in real-tim and “should” prevent you from compil or run code with error in it. i’v chosen sonarlint becaus it given me better result than es6 linter or some other lint tool that i’v tried. i’m not say it the best or that the other don’t work but I haven’t had to configur much other than just instal the extension. scratchpad (built-in browser javascript sandbox) mozilla also offer a featur in their devtool that allow you to write, run, and view the output of javascript code that can interact with the current web page or not. repl I have a background in .net develop and I have fallen in love with microsoft’ F# languag along with the fsharp community. while go through the document I wa introduc to a new term, repl. repl stand for: read-evaluate-print-loop. “ In a repl, the user enter one or more express (rather than an entir compil unit) and the repl evalu them and display the results.” -wikipedia So I thought, thi wa cool and I use my googliness™️ to search for an onlin version or servic and so I came upon this. repl.it I don’t need to console.log my output or assign the function to var result = greeting() and then console.log(greeting(\"jessica\")) . I just write my function, invok it and boom! I get the output without the need of console.log() . repl.it support mani languages! I can even creat a repl, write some code and share the link with someon that can give me feedback, brilliant! coincidentally, repl.it use monaco, which is the same editor that vscode uses. finally, for the develop on a budget (includ myself) most popular ide have a built-in debugg that work the same wa as the debugg in chrome or firefox. i’v kindli ad link to how-tos: for a few ide (don’t get mad if your ide is not listed, i’m look at you atom ide community). debug in vscode debug in jetbrain intellij debug in visual studio final thought So whi have I gone through the long wind troubl of explain / tri to convinc you whi you should wean yourself off of use the console.log and embrac debug tools? how wa thi suppos to make you feel better / more confid in write code? the short answer is: I believ have more inform and proper tool “should” make coding, and for that matter debugging, less daunt / scary. use of wide available, open-sourc debug tool is key to be more familiar with softwar develop and to grow as a developer. join us_ we\\'r excit to launch our new codeup newsletter, which highlight some interest blog posts, thing in the know, and upcom events.

       "  'lemmatized': 'When you’re scared to run your code, and it work the first try (Halloween style)! When I first started a a developer I ran into some scary scenarios. My code wa very error prone and I created some function that I wa expecting a string a the output but I got an object. It wa very frustrating and I wasn’t even sure I would be able to understand software development let alone have to go and fix my code. My nightmare scenario wa to be hired on a a developer and then have to troubleshoot, a.k.a. debug, some other developer code😱😱😱. I think most junior developer have had shared my fear at some point in their career. I wa taught to heavily rely upon outputting your result to the console whether it good or bad to help troubleshoot. In this post I will do my best to help calm the fear of my fellow junior developer with helpful debugging tool and hopefully transition away from relying upon console.log(). While my focus will be on JavaScript these tool can easily be translated to other languages. Logging output to the console isn’t always helpful For the longest time console.log() wa my go-to when I needed to debug JavaScript code. It wa my developer friend who told me what wa wrong with my code and wa never judgemental . I will admit that there are few scenario where it is “OK” to output the result of a function to the console. Except more recently, I have found using console.log() to be le useful when debugging and only making thing worse by expecting a good outcome and then disappointing me. Like an expired $5 Amazon Gift Card (Thanks, grandma). Take for example, this gem: Object doesn\\'t support property or method \\'from\\' That lovely error is from IE 11 which doe not support Array.from(node List) prototype without a shim/poly fill that is available here. However, I have come to find out that logging error to the console is either inefficient or completely irrelevant to what may actually be causing the problem in your code. I will admit that some error are easily resolved by reading the output of the error message and fixing the typo or following the instruction of the error message to help resolve the problem. So in the image above we are shown a node item which ha so many property that you might not be aware of, which render console.log useless. You have to know ahead of time what value or specific attribute you are trying to output which requires some abstract thinking or referencing documentation to identify this property. Now using the console.log will output all the entire property of the node item but it an unnecessary step to add in this line of code while you debug and then go back and remove the line of code. “You don’t know what you don’t know” -Bill Parcel (Head Coach New England Patriots) The error the console output might provide you with the location of the error, but you may not know why are you getting the error in the first place. Maybe you’re passing the incorrect value to the function or you are working with event handling and bubbling events. Either way, chance are that you aren’t thinking about that one property that is actually passing the value your expecting because you weren’t aware of how to call it or pas it along. I’m going to piggy back off of Mozilla’s Debug Playground a an example for why you shouldn’t use the console and instead use the Browsers built-in debugger or equally a helpful is an IDE’s built-in debugger. cough cough Visual Studio Code cough cough Now, whether you prefer Chrome over FireFox is a whole different can-o-worms. IDE Tools and Online REPLs “Hey man, I’m a back-end developer and so I need to console.log” -Fictional Backend Developer So maybe you don’t have a fully fleshed out web form or you’re trying to get data from some API or JSON file. You need to see data from the function you’re writing or better yet you want to test a function that someone else wrote without having to clone the entire project. Using console.log() seems like the go to. In fact, around ¾ of Node.js developer report using it (in 2017) for finding error in their applications. I’m here to tell you of a few better way to debug your code. IDE Tools The first tool I have come to love and trust is one made by a company called Wallaby.js QuokkaJS (Integrated Scratchpad for JavaScript) With this plug-in you can write your code and get immediate results. No need to throw in a bunch of console.log’s in your function and check the output. It ha an integration for VSCode (💖💖💖 ), JetBrainsIDE and Atom. I personally have purchased a pro license but for the most part the community version will work just fine. SonarLint ( Like spellcheck but for your code) I think all developer should have some sort of code linting tool added into their IDE. This help review your code in real-time and “should” prevent you from compiling or running code with error in it. I’ve chosen SonarLint because it given me better result than ES6 linter or some other linting tool that i’ve tried. I’m not saying it the best or that the others don’t work but I haven’t had to configure much other than just installing the extension. Scratchpad (Built-in Browser Javascript sandbox) Mozilla also offer a feature in their DevTools that allows you to write, run, and view the output of JavaScript code that can interact with the current web page or not.

Coincidentally, Repl.it us Monaco, which is the same Editor that VSCode uses. Finally, for the developer on a budget (including myself) most popular IDEs have a built-in debugger that work the same wa a the debugger in Chrome or Firefox. I’ve kindly added link to How-Tos: For a few IDEs (don’t get mad if your IDE is not listed, I’m looking at you Atom IDE community). Debugging in VSCode Debugging in JetBrains IntelliJ Debugging in Visual Studio Final Thoughts So why have I gone through the long winded trouble of explaining / trying to convince you why you should wean yourself off of using the console.log and embrace debugging tools? How wa this suppose to make you feel better / more confident in writing code? The short answer is: I believe having more information and proper tool “should” make coding, and for that matter debugging, le daunting / scary. Use of widely available, open-source debugging tool is key to be more familiar with software development and to grow a a developer.

Each student had a duck at their seat on the first day of our 18 ½ week advanced full stack web development boot camp.

Starting my computing career at Trinity University has proven to be extremely important; all the hours spent on algorithm design, data structures, logic are all essential in what I’m doing now. However, it is not an uncommon idea that what colleges teach can sometimes be at an offset to industry demands. I experienced this significant gap between employer expectations and my computing skill-set post college, and with the\\xa0I-need-a-job-to-get-experience-to-work-for-a-job-that-requires-experience\\xa0catch that most college graduates experience the first few years of leaving academia, I found myself struggling to find employment. The first year of leaving my university was a humbling yet soul-crushing experience. Why is it that I’ve pursued a degree directly related to such a hungry market for software developers, but I am unable to find a job? Among what seemed like an endless stream of interviews in which I partook, I began to notice a trend – I lacked full stack development experience with relevant programming languages that are currently in demand. Turns out, having the theoretical knowledge isn’t enough for most employers in the market. The industry of software development has evolved throughout the years of its existence, and with its evolution came new programming languages that better suit the needs of its users and the customers it will eventually serve. Ultimately, logical thinking did not trump most self-taught HTML, CSS, Javascript developers that fill the market with highly innovative ideas and projects.\\nAs a Trinity graduate who still lived in San Antonio after graduating, I learned more about Codeup from peers who contributed to the curriculum and program’s growth. Some of my classmates in my department also attended the program and found great opportunities within the industry upon graduating the program. At first, I was skeptical of the value Codeup could bring to someone like me who already had experience in programming, albeit in languages that weren’t exactly in demand. But, being unemployed and discouraged for seemingly an eternity, I decided to give it a go.\\nThe program was an introduction to programming, which is very different from my experience in college. Since I was verbose in the structure and characteristics of software development, it was easily digestible. The curriculum consisted of introductions to different programming languages, and most importantly, showed me how everything pieced together to form working and aesthetically pleasing products that definitely had the potential to be client facing projects that serve the public. It was an eye-opening experience for me: seeing and experiencing web development with relevant technologies like MVC, ES6, and the Spring Framework. As most of the course material were quickly grasped by my existing mode of thinking, I spent most of my time on the assignments, perfecting them and pushing myself to create difficult effects or programs. The instructors were all extremely helpful and understanding of my background, and were even nice enough to provide me with bonus assignments to push what I’ve learned to its limits.\\nI never would have guessed that Codeup would benefit me in the way it did. Within a week of graduating, I found a job as a Salesforce Developer at a consulting company here in San Antonio. Together with the knowledge I’ve obtained from my degree, I have put everything I learned at Codeup to use: creating real products used by thousands of real users. I wouldn’t be here without the experience I had, not just with the curriculum, but with the excellent career placement staff at Codeup.

       "  'original': '\\nI remember during my first day of Codeup I began to doubt my ability to overcome the challenges that lay ahead.\\xa0I soon learned that what I was experiencing was “impostor syndrome.” Jason Straughan, Codeup’s CEO, introduced us to this phenomenon that same day. Thanks to his kind advice I was able to identify, and overcome my doubts.\\xa0Codeup shared many valuable lessons with me, but some lessons were taught through exposure outside of the Vogue building. If you decide to enroll at Codeup, you will find yourself learning many things outside the classroom.\\xa0I realized through my own journey that there are things Codeup didn’t tell me. So, I’ve narrowed it down to the 5 main things I had to learn on my own as a newly placed software developer.\\nYou Need to be Multilingual\\n\\nYou need to be adaptable and willing to open your ears to all ideas. They say the best way to learn a different language is through practice. In most of our professional and non-professional lives, relationships will have an assigned lingo to properly cater to that relationship. Furthermore, professional groups and organizations like projectQUEST, H-E-B, and Codeup have their own kind of language. These languages are used to identify and recognize individuals of that group or organization. It is important to keep this in mind before you start ANY application process, or start working with new people.\\nEven though I did not have a college degree, I still had an interest in developing coding skills. I understood early on in my application process that I was in control of my outcome. I assumed determination contained the key to my success, and soon found myself being referred to ProjectQUEST for financial assistance.I would have never known about ProjectQUEST if the Codeup staff had not offered this vital information. The dedication and support offered by these organizations helped me through the multiple application processes. If you plan to visit projectQUEST or Workforce Solutions to inquire about their grants, make sure you’re determined to learn their language, and earn the money. If you have the right amount of determination you can find the proper channels fueling San Antonio’s STEM ecosystem through a simple Google search. Determination is one of the common denominators all Codeup graduates share, and if you too share this similarity, check out the\\xa0scholarships\\xa0offered by Codeup.\\nPeople want jobs, but not everyone wants to work.\\n\\nvia GIPHY\\nCodeup’s mission statement is the following, “At Codeup, we focus on two things: you and your success. Find a job within six months of graduation,\\xa0or get 50% of your tuition returned.” Let me assure you they deliver in service, \\xa0content, and in career guidance. However, the staff cannot force you to either study the curriculum or develop programming skills for you. There are people that come ready to overcome adversity, then there are the few who expect to be fed morning tacos with a silver spoon. If you’re seriously considering Codeup, you need to prepare yourself to manage the beautiful chaos of assignments, interviews, and presentations.\\nMy high school soccer coach had a saying, “Do you think Ronaldo is going to parachute from a helicopter and score for you?” We never expected Ronaldo at our high school practices but that was our coach handing down some of his kind wisdom. He used this as a tactic to build the team up before the start of our shooting drills. Ronaldo is a world star player who plays at a professional level so what coach Ramos was really trying to say was, “Work hard if you want the goal. Don’t expect someone to come and score for you!” You need to have a sense of responsibility before embarking on your own journey and launching your career.\\nHave a servant’s heart.\\nSome lessons weren’t coming from a screen or projector and I considered these some of my favorite lessons because they spoke more about human character. A perfect example is when the Codeup staff noticed a need in our community and decided to share their passion for service with all San Antonians. The office staff\\xa0volunteered to serve\\xa0at the San Antonio Food Bank. This was one of the unspoken teachings Codeup shared with me – these amazing individuals create an environment where you can grow in skill and as a human being. Kudos to them!\\nI will iterate once again that Codeup will not force you to do something you don’t want to do. As a newly placed member of this ecosystem and a Codeup graduate I would like to ask Codeup fellows and members of the community to ponder, “How are we contributing to the San Antonio ecosystem?” Having the heart of a servant is something Codeup can’t force you to do, but is a skill necessary to achieve self growth and development.\\nDon’t eat the tacos!\\n\\nvia GIPHY\\nCodeup is geared to focus on your professional life, and not your waistline. The Codeup family loves to spoil the cohorts with food, they must know the way to a developer’s heart. The morning tacos, the pizza, and snacks should be enough to lure you into the Vogue building. I loved every bite and sip of these delicious perks. However I do have to confess I gained a few pounds during my time at Codeup. I was also on a budget so the ramen noodle isle at the Walgreens became very familiar. Now that I look back I wish I only had one slice of pizza instead of my usual three.\\nOne of the hardest parts of my Codeup journey was finding time to exercise. Taking care of myself felt impossible in this intense immersive environment, but believe me when I say “It is possible!” This was thanks to one of my colleagues, who insisted on completing daily reps of stairs up and down the Travis Park garage.I felt instant restoration after just a few days of exercise. This simple exercise routine helped me deal with stress and gave me enough time to meditate on the things that pushed me towards triumph.\\nDon’t bite the hand that feeds you.\\nThe saying “Don’t bite the hand that feeds you” has stuck with me since I was thirteen years old, and made the dumb decision to complain about my job in front of my dad. My dad was not fond of me complaining of the man who signed my checks, so he shared a lesson behind his belligerent words. This made me realize that my ego was blocking my ability to humble myself, and that I needed to be thankful to the people that were trying to help me. His wise words taught me to stay loyal to those who become part of my upbringing.\\nThis saying has stuck with me ever since, and I decided to mark it as a special lesson. A lesson I could only acquired through experience. I realize now the same goes with any organization or relationship that we hold, professional or non professional. We should be able to acknowledge where our loyalties stand, and if we are giving the proper amount of recognition to those who have helped us.\\nThe Codeup staff did everything in their power to plug me into a bigger network of opportunities. Lastly, I was exposed to a network of genuinely loving, and caring people. These amazing benefits make me appreciate the\\xa0Codeup program\\xa0so much more. I walked in with the desire to learn computer programming. I am leaving with the ability and skills that say “I am a software developer!”\\n',\n",

I walk in with the desir to learn comput programming. I am leav with the abil and skill that say “I am a softwar developer!”',\n",
       "  'lemmatized': 'I remember during my first day of Codeup I began to doubt my ability to overcome the challenge that lay ahead. I soon learned that what I wa experiencing wa “impostor syndrome.” Jason Straughan, Codeup’s CEO, introduced u to this phenomenon that same day. Thanks to his kind advice I wa able to identify, and overcome my doubts. Codeup shared many valuable lesson with me, but some lesson were taught through exposure outside of the Vogue building. If you decide to enroll at Codeup, you will find yourself learning many thing outside the classroom. I realized through my own journey that there are thing Codeup didn’t tell me. So, I’ve narrowed it down to the 5 main thing I had to learn on my own a a newly placed software developer. You Need to be Multilingual You need to be adaptable and willing to open your ear to all ideas. They say the best way to learn a different language is through practice. In most of our professional and non-professional lives, relationship will have an assigned lingo to properly cater to that relationship. Furthermore, professional group and organization like projectQUEST, H-E-B, and Codeup have their own kind of language. These language are used to identify and recognize individual of that group or organization. It is important to keep this in mind before you start ANY application process, or start working with new people. Even though I did not have a college degree, I still had an interest in developing coding skills. I understood early on in my application process that I wa in control of my outcome. I assumed determination contained the key to my success, and soon found myself being referred to ProjectQUEST for financial assistance.I would have never known about ProjectQUEST if the Codeup staff had not offered this vital information. The dedication and support offered by these organization helped me through the multiple application processes. If you plan to visit projectQUEST or Workforce Solutions to inquire about their grants, make sure you’re determined to learn their language, and earn the money. If you have the right amount of determination you can find the proper channel fueling San Antonio’s STEM ecosystem through a simple Google search. Determination is one of the common denominator all Codeup graduate share, and if you too share this similarity, check out the scholarship offered by Codeup. People want jobs, but not everyone want to work. via GIPHY Codeup’s mission statement is the following, “At Codeup, we focus on two things: you and your success. Find a job within six month of graduation, or get 50% of your tuition returned.” Let me assure you they deliver in service, content, and in career guidance. However, the staff cannot force you to either study the curriculum or develop programming skill for you. There are people that come ready to overcome adversity, then there are the few who expect to be fed morning taco with a silver spoon. If you’re seriously considering Codeup, you need to prepare yourself to manage the beautiful chaos of assignments, interviews, and presentations. My high school soccer coach had a saying, “Do you think Ronaldo is going to parachute from a helicopter and score for you?” We never expected Ronaldo at our high school practice but that wa our coach handing down some of his kind wisdom. He used this a a tactic to build the team up before the start of our shooting drills. Ronaldo is a world star player who play at a professional level so what coach Ramos wa really trying to say was, “Work hard if you want the goal. Don’t expect someone to come and score for you!” You need to have a sense of responsibility before embarking on your own journey and launching your career. Have a servant’s heart. Some lesson weren’t coming from a screen or projector and I considered these some of my favorite lesson because they spoke more about human character. A perfect example is when the Codeup staff noticed a need in our community and decided to share their passion for service with all San Antonians. The office staff volunteered to serve at the San Antonio Food Bank. This wa one of the unspoken teaching Codeup shared with me – these amazing individual create an environment where you can grow in skill and a a human being. Kudos to them! I will iterate once again that Codeup will not force you to do something you don’t want to do. As a newly placed member of this ecosystem and a Codeup graduate I would like to ask Codeup fellow and member of the community to ponder, “How are we contributing to the San Antonio ecosystem?” Having the heart of a servant is something Codeup can’t force you to do, but is a skill necessary to achieve self growth and development. Don’t eat the tacos! via GIPHY Codeup is geared to focus on your professional life, and not your waistline. The Codeup family love to spoil the cohort with food, they must know the way to a developer’s heart. The morning tacos, the pizza, and snack should be enough to lure you into the Vogue building. I loved every bite and sip of these delicious perks. However I do have to confess I gained a few pound during my time at Codeup. I wa also on a budget so the ramen noodle isle at the Walgreens became very familiar. Now that I look back I wish I only had one slice of pizza instead of my usual three. One of the hardest part of my Codeup journey wa finding time to exercise. Taking care of myself felt impossible in this intense immersive environment, but believe me when I say “It is possible!” This wa thanks to one of my colleagues, who insisted on completing daily rep of stair up and down the Travis Park garage.I felt instant restoration after just a few day of exercise. This simple exercise routine helped me deal with stress and gave me enough time to meditate on the thing that pushed me towards triumph. Don’t bite the hand that feed you. The saying “Don’t bite the hand that feed you” ha stuck with me since I wa thirteen year old, and made the dumb decision to complain about my job in front of my dad. My dad wa not fond of me complaining of the man who signed my checks, so he shared a lesson behind his belligerent words. This made me realize that my ego wa blocking my ability to humble myself, and that I needed to be thankful to the people that were trying to help me. His wise word taught me to stay loyal to those who become part of my upbringing. This saying ha stuck with me ever since, and I decided to mark it a a special lesson. A lesson I could only acquired through experience. I realize now the same go with any organization or relationship that we hold, professional or non professional. We should be able to acknowledge where our loyalty stand, and if we are giving the proper amount of recognition to those who have helped us. The Codeup staff did everything in their power to plug me into a bigger network of opportunities. Lastly, I wa exposed to a network of genuinely loving, and caring people. These amazing benefit make me appreciate the Codeup program so much more. I walked in with the desire to learn computer programming. I am leaving with the ability and skill that say “I am a software developer!”',\n",

       "  'original': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI hope you’ve got your resumes ready, because\\xa0Codeup’s\\xa0bi-annual\\xa0Tech Job Fair\\xa0is coming back this Fall! For most people, this is an exciting event, full of opportunity and new beginnings. While for some, the words “Job Fair” provoke anxiety and a deep-seated fear of proper handshaking.\\n\\n(via GIPHY)\\nTo help a few of you entry-level folks out there, I sat down with my boss Fred Tawil – President of\\xa0Swipetrack Solutions\\xa0– and asked him if he had some advice for anyone attending the Job Fair in September.\\nInterview With the Boss\\nHow did you get into tech?\\nI taught myself how to program years and years ago. When I graduated as a political science major, I needed something to do. My dad owned bingo halls and he needed a player tracking system, so I figured okay, I’ll make a player tracking system. I taught myself how to program, I built the kiosk and built the software to run the player tracking.\\nAs someone who didn’t formally study something like CS, what has been the most difficult thing about managing a bunch of programmers?\\xa0\\nI don’t know. Everybody has their own method of programming and development. It’s that balancing act between getting something done quick and getting it done right. It’s figuring out how much time we can spend making it reliable versus getting it deployed.\\nThat’s true. There’s always something new coming out in this industry.\\nYeah, it’s always good to keep an eye out on what’s coming up, that way you’re not stuck when something gets depreciated or reaches its end-of-life.\\nWhen you’re hiring, do you typically read everyone’s resumes?\\nIt depends. We typically glance at them. I understand that a lot of Codeup grads weren’t in tech and are trying to move into it. That’s actually good for us, especially as a small company. We like to see previous work history so we can hire someone with multiple skills.\\nBack when you were conducting the interviews yourself, what are some things that would make a candidate stand out to you?\\nMost of the time when we’re hiring, we get a lot of competent coders that come to see us, and we see lots and lots of resumes. But an important thing for us now is, will this person fit in with the environment and will they like working here? When it comes down to the interview, you can be a competent coder, but what we want to know is if you’ll mesh with the group of people here and if you’re someone we can work with day to day.\\nHow important would you say it is for someone to have a personal website and to have recent commits on GitHub?\\nI can tell you we looked at everyone’s personal website if their resume looked good. GitHub accounts not so much, because a lot of the time when someone is coming from a coding bootcamp they’re all the same. A lot of the websites also looked similar, but if there was a way that you set yours apart, we saw those and those were pretty interesting.\\nFor us it’s not so much what you did while you were at Codeup, it’s what else you did. Show me that you really enjoy programming and that you do it in your free time, as opposed to just looking for a higher paycheck. Do you have any apps in the App store, or a web application you made? Did you actually spend time on your website? I can tell you we do look at the source code and make sure if we’re hiring somebody that they didn’t just use a theme they bought on the internet and are pretending they built it. It’s very easy to tell.\\nDo you have any advice for anyone who is nervous about going to their first Tech Job Fair?\\xa0\\nIt might be different, but I think it’s more laid-back. I would say to just relax. The three or four times we did it, we enjoyed talking to people and finding those whose personalities stood out. So be relaxed, enjoy it, and just talk.\\nFrom Personal Experience\\xa0\\xa0\\nI clearly remember attending my first\\xa0Tech Job Fair\\xa0back in 2017, only because I was extremely anxious every day leading up to the event. I would go to\\xa0Geekdom\\xa0after class and had late nights to make sure that my website and online profiles were ready to go. Once the day came and I got there, my first thought was to run back to the car.\\n(Image: Tenor)\\nThree Easy Steps\\nWhether you’re planning to attend the Tech Job Fair to find employment or to network, it’s completely normal to be a little worried about it. So here’s my advice:\\n\\nDo Your Research\\n\\nI can vouch for the importance of doing a little research before attending. Make sure to look at the list of companies who will be there and make a mental note of those that really interest you. You’ll be better off and more prepared to ask all the right questions.\\n\\nIntroduce Yourself\\n\\nIf you’re not quite sure how, “Hello, my name is…” goes a long way.\\n\\nFollow Up\\n\\nThis is the step that most people forget. If you find a place that you fall in love with, you need to follow up. Why wouldn’t you? That would be like falling head over heels for someone on the first date and forgetting to call. There are plenty of fish in the sea and a simple email thanking them for their time could be the reason they remember your name.\\nPro Tip:\\xa0If you’re currently in Codeup, you can even invite them to\\xa0Demo Day\\xa0and have another shot at impressing them with your new skills.\\n\\nvia GIPHY\\nBottom Line\\nMost importantly,\\xa0STAY TRUE TO YOURSELF. Getting hired into a new company is a lot like entering a new relationship. Companies want to hire someone they can get along with everyday – someone who values their work and the company culture.

       "  'lemmatized': 'I hope you’ve got your resume ready, because Codeup’s bi-annual Tech Job Fair is coming back this Fall! For most people, this is an exciting event, full of opportunity and new beginnings. While for some, the word “Job Fair” provoke anxiety and a deep-seated fear of proper handshaking. (via GIPHY) To help a few of you entry-level folk out there, I sat down with my bos Fred Tawil – President of Swipetrack Solutions – and asked him if he had some advice for anyone attending the Job Fair in September. Interview With the Boss How did you get into tech? I taught myself how to program year and year ago. When I graduated a a political science major, I needed something to do. My dad owned bingo hall and he needed a player tracking system, so I figured okay, I’ll make a player tracking system. I taught myself how to program, I built the kiosk and built the software to run the player tracking. As someone who didn’t formally study something like CS, what ha been the most difficult thing about managing a bunch of programmers? I don’t know. Everybody ha their own method of programming and development. It’s that balancing act between getting something done quick and getting it done right. It’s figuring out how much time we can spend making it reliable versus getting it deployed. That’s true. There’s always something new coming out in this industry. Yeah, it’s always good to keep an eye out on what’s coming up, that way you’re not stuck when something get depreciated or reach it end-of-life. When you’re hiring, do you typically read everyone’s resumes? It depends. We typically glance at them. I understand that a lot of Codeup grad weren’t in tech and are trying to move into it. That’s actually good for us, especially a a small company. We like to see previous work history so we can hire someone with multiple skills. Back when you were conducting the interview yourself, what are some thing that would make a candidate stand out to you? Most of the time when we’re hiring, we get a lot of competent coder that come to see us, and we see lot and lot of resumes. But an important thing for u now is, will this person fit in with the environment and will they like working here? When it come down to the interview, you can be a competent coder, but what we want to know is if you’ll mesh with the group of people here and if you’re someone we can work with day to day. How important would you say it is for someone to have a personal website and to have recent commits on GitHub? I can tell you we looked at everyone’s personal website if their resume looked good. GitHub account not so much, because a lot of the time when someone is coming from a coding bootcamp they’re all the same. A lot of the website also looked similar, but if there wa a way that you set yours apart, we saw those and those were pretty interesting. For u it’s not so much what you did while you were at Codeup, it’s what else you did. Show me that you really enjoy programming and that you do it in your free time, a opposed to just looking for a higher paycheck. Do you have any apps in the App store, or a web application you made? Did you actually spend time on your website? I can tell you we do look at the source code and make sure if we’re hiring somebody that they didn’t just use a theme they bought on the internet and are pretending they built it. It’s very easy to tell. Do you have any advice for anyone who is nervous about going to their first Tech Job Fair? It might be different, but I think it’s more laid-back. I would say to just relax. The three or four time we did it, we enjoyed talking to people and finding those whose personality stood out. So be relaxed, enjoy it, and just talk. From Personal Experience I clearly remember attending my first Tech Job Fair back in 2017, only because I wa extremely anxious every day leading up to the event. I would go to Geekdom after class and had late night to make sure that my website and online profile were ready to go. Once the day came and I got there, my first thought wa to run back to the car. (Image: Tenor) Three Easy Steps Whether you’re planning to attend the Tech Job Fair to find employment or to network, it’s completely normal to be a little worried about it. So here’s my advice: Do Your Research I can vouch for the importance of doing a little research before attending. Make sure to look at the list of company who will be there and make a mental note of those that really interest you. You’ll be better off and more prepared to ask all the right questions. Introduce Yourself If you’re not quite sure how, “Hello, my name is…” go a long way. Follow Up This is the step that most people forget. If you find a place that you fall in love with, you need to follow up. Why wouldn’t you? That would be like falling head over heel for someone on the first date and forgetting to call. There are plenty of fish in the sea and a simple email thanking them for their time could be the reason they remember your name. Pro Tip: If you’re currently in Codeup, you can even invite them to Demo Day and have another shot at impressing them with your new skills. via GIPHY Bottom Line Most importantly, STAY TRUE TO YOURSELF. Getting hired into a new company is a lot like entering a new relationship. Companies want to hire someone they can get along with everyday – someone who value their work and the company culture. Ultimately, you want to be hired by people who “get” you. It’s usually easy to tell when someone is not being genuine, so avoid pretending to be someone you’re not.

We’ll interview a student over the course of the 4.5 months to see how things are progressing from first impressions all the way to graduation. Thus, welcome to the Codeup Student Check In: Month 1!\\nWe took the time to sit down with our Wrangell student to see how they’ve been doing so far!\\nCodeup: How did you hear about Codeup? Why did you want to apply?\\nWrangell Student: My first encounter with Codeup was during a drive downtown. I’m glancing at billboards while I’m driving and I see Codeup on one of the billboards. I remember thinking I wasn’t fully satisfied with my position in life, and my future goals aligned with Codeup’s mission. So I took a risk and applied.\\nC: What was the application process like?\\nS: The\\xa0application process\\xa0is very easy to understand. You apply directly on the website, and a member of the team reaches out to you. There are a few steps in the process itself, including an interview, a campus visit and a skills assessment.\\nC: Tell us about any financing options/grants/scholarships you received. Did you owe anything out of pocket?\\nS: I’m very happy to report my expenses are fully covered by a few grants and scholarships. The City of San Antonio\\xa0Workforce Solutions\\xa0grant, the Alamo College Techworks grant, and the\\xa0Women’s Scholarship\\xa0all helped to cover the cost so that I paid nothing out of pocket.\\nC: Describe a typical day for you from start to finish\\nS: We start off with announcements and then what we call “push-ups,” which are morning exercises to practice our chops. Sometimes we work on yesterday’s assignment, or we \\xa0jump straight into lecture. After lecture we practice the material with an exercise. Then we have a lunch break. After lunch we come back and listen to afternoon announcements. We have lecture time again, followed by another exercise.\\nC: Describe what you’re learning right now. Is it hard/fun/challenging?\\nS: Right now we are learning how to interact with the Google Maps API. This is probably the most challenging thing we’ve gone over so far. It’s very different extracting and working with code that is not your own. It feels like learning coding conventions all over again. But it’s still a lot of fun!\\nC: How has the learning process/information gathering been?\\nS: The learning process has been amazing. We use the Codeup curriculum website in combination with other resources, such as developer websites, and program documentation.\\nC: What has been the most memorable part of this month?\\nS: It is empowering seeing a project idea go from a blank slate to \\xa0a full functioning program. The most memorable part of this month was the first time I ran a program and saw all the colors and components jump out at me on the screen.\\nC: How do you feel your skill level compares to when you started?\\nS: My skill level has definitely increased compared to where I was initially. I think one of the most valuable things I’ve been taught are the tools that developers use on a daily basis such as\\xa0Github, git, Node, the IntelliJ IDE and more.\\nC: How have the instructors been helpful?\\nS: The instructors are very receptive to feedback. They recognize that their students are extremely diverse with different skill levels, and respond in an understanding manner. They also encourage us to work hard for a problem answer, rather than just giving it to us outright.\\nC:\\xa0 Can you share a fun experience you have had this month?\\nS: It is so much fun talking to my classmates and realizing how kind and open they are. I initially wanted to be alone on my lunch break, but then I had so much fun eating lunch with my classmates! I feel that Codeup is even helping me overcome my shy nature, and feeling the change within myself is fun and enlightening.\\n',\n",

The Codeup graduate has set a new standard at Digiboost, by not only meeting expectations but exceeding them with his passion for technological innovation. From humble beginnings as a military child, moving from place to place, to building a life in San Antonio, Texas, Cayden is a one of a kind talent, displaying a multitude of skills ranging from CSS, JavaScript, PHP and troubleshooting methods for solving developmental problems.

In just 16 weeks, Cayden was certified in Full-Stack Development, dubbed the status of Junior Software Developer, and matched up with one of Codeup’s employer partners. The Codeup program is dedicated to providing its students with the skills necessary to effectively land an entry level coding position and launch their career in software development. \\n“Codeup was designed exactly the way I needed it to be,” Simler said. “I gained the ability to problem solve, debug and learn new coding languages quickly.

       "  'original': '\\nTop Trends and Tools for Recruiters in the Tech Industry\\n\\xa0\\nBy Taylor McKinney\\nRecruiting new talent is never an easy task. But within the tech industry, it’s even more tricky—you want candidates with sharp skills and competitive experience, but also those who can make room to grow and adapt to new changes. The methods you use to recruit will directly influence who you attract, so you’ll need to get innovative with your strategies if you want the best. Here are the top innovative measures being used in recruiting for the tech industry today.\\nAssessing Coding Skills\\nA candidate with formal coding education is a must. A candidate with years of workplace experience is even better. But neither will necessarily guarantee you’re getting the best developer or programmer possible. That’s where coding assessments come in. This skill-based method makes the recruitment easier by relying on hard data, which reduces unnecessary decision making and possible bias. It’s the closest you’ll get to knowing exactly how capable a candidate is, and exactly how they’ll perform, logistically speaking, for your business.\\nChatbot Interviews\\nThe interview process can be timely and even expensive, especially if you’re hoping to attract global or out-of-town candidates. Whether you use it for the interview itself or just the pre-screening process, a virtual session makes more efficient use of the selection process, both in time, money, and convenience. Try Google Hangouts or Skype for a free method, or check out a software review site for the best video interview software available.\\nMore Efficient Applicant Tracking\\nThese systems are known for being cumbersome and, ironically, even inefficient because they’re so often hard to use or even used incorrectly. The good news is that these systems are simplifying their programs with the help of AI and rebranding themselves as “candidate relationship management software”. Employers can now count on these programs to correctly track all potentials without error, as well as recommend new qualified candidates.\\nA New Way of Interviewing\\nThe standard “Where do you see yourself in five years?” question-and-answer interviews aren’t necessarily a bad thing, but they probably won’t land you any innovative hires. That’s why they’ve begun to fall by the wayside, especially in the tech world.\\nWhile the core questions are still important, tech companies are now rebranding their strategies to shake things up a bit and make room for assessing soft skills and personality—the areas in which traditional interviews fall short.\\nFor example, the NFL susses out potential candidates by using Wonderlic, an online personality test that assesses emotional intelligence, determination, and overall demeanor.\\xa0 Companies are also ditching conformity by trying out unconventional meeting places like a coffee shop or cafe. It’s all about getting to know a candidate better in a more dimensional way, and these new tools and methods are a way to get to know a truer sense of a person overall.\\nAnd what about helping out with the time-consuming task of recruiting? Here are some of TrustRadius’s Top Rated recruiting software for 2018, which help streamline the recruitment process of searching for, attracting, interviewing, and onboarding new personnel.\\nOracle HCM Cloud\\nTrustRadius Score: 7.7 out of 10\\nBest suited for large companies with many employees, a considerable budget, and complex needs.

       "  'original': '\\n10 Tips to Crush It at the SA Tech Job Fair\\nSA Tech Job Fair\\nThe third bi-annual San Antonio Tech Job Fair is just around the corner. Over 25 companies will be at The Jack Guenther Pavilion\\xa0on April 10th, and they are hungry for new tech team members!\\nAt the job fair, companies want to quickly source a list of new talent leads. AKA they need to find qualified employees they can begin interviewing for jobs. Recruiters will represent their organization at tables with informational handouts and company swag. Your goal at a job fair is to set yourself apart from other candidates and ensure your name makes it to the top of those lead lists.\\nThink of your interaction with the company as a mini screening interview. The company rep will subtly evaluate basic qualities like your professionalism, communication and interpersonal skills, work experience, and interest level in the organization. Job fairs are also an opportunity for you to gain information about companies that may not be easily accessible online. \\xa0\\nAt Codeup, we’re passionate about bridging the gap between talent and demand, so we’ve outlined 10 tips to ensure you bring your A-game and leave a lasting impression!\\n10 Tips for Totally Crushing it at the SA Tech Job Fair\\n\\nUse keywords to describe your skills, but don’t go overboard. You’ll probably be talking to a recruiter or talent acquisition specialist. As a technical candidate, recognize these individuals usually aren’t developers or network administrators. They know terms like “JavaScript” and “Apache,” but haven’t written a line of code or spun up a server, so don’t get too caught up in industry jargon.\\nResearch the companies ahead of time. Review the list of attending companies and make sure you know what the company does and whether or not they hire people in your desired role. Look up recent news on the company and mention it during your conversation.\\nDefine your own goals for the job fair. Are you searching for a specific type of role or company culture? What matters most in your job search? Are there companies you want to prioritize? \\xa0Develop a game plan and be intentional with your time.\\nPrepare a stellar résumé. Bring about 20 copies of your résumé to the event, printed on nice paper. We won’t cover resume writing in this post, but there are a plethora of online resources you can consult. For job fairs, don’t worry about cover letters.\\nPolish your online profiles. If recruiters have a copy of your resume, you can be sure they will stalk you online soon. Make sure your online presence is professional and appropriate. A good place to start is by Googling yourself. Update your LinkedIn, and clean up any social media profiles.\\nCraft a 30-60 second elevator pitch. You may only have a few minutes with an employer. What will you say if they ask, “Tell me about yourself?” Consider structuring your pitch like this: Who you are + What you do + What your goals are + Why that matters to the company.\\nDon’t show up in a t-shirt, but trade in your suit for something more chill. Always keep it professional, but remember: tech is typically more casual than other industries. You’ll likely feel out of place if you look like you belong on Wall St., so refer to this guide on dressing for tech interviews.\\nDon’t forget the basics. Start and end each conversation with a firm handshake. Make eye contact while conversing. Smile! Thank the recruiter before you move on to the next table.\\nAsk educated questions. Don’t waste valuable face time with recruiters by asking questions like, “What does [Insert Company here] do?” They hate that question! Instead, try some of these:\\n\\nWhat are the top 3-5 examples of knowledge, skills, and abilities you look for in candidates?\\nWhat’s the best advice you have for someone who wants to work here?\\nWhat is your interview process like?\\nAre you hiring for any roles not currently listed on your websites?\\n\\n\\nFollow up. Collect business cards from each table. The next day, send a short note expressing your interest in the company’s opportunities and thanking the recruiter for his or her time.\\n\\nRSVP for the SA Tech Job Fair taking place at the Jack Guenther Pavilion – September 18th starting at 4 pm.\\xa0\\n',\n",

       "  'original': '\\n5 Hiring Trends in Software Development\\n\\xa0\\nCompanies (and ideal candidates) care about solving problems for the end user.\\nHiring needs in the tech industry – specifically on software development teams – evolve almost as quickly as the technologies themselves. One year employers are trying to get their hands on Ruby developers, and 12 months later, a new JavaScript framework is all the buzz. This doesn’t make things easy for job seekers or new employers looking to hire their first software developers.\\nDrawing on conversations with our 200+ employer partners at Codeup, we’ve compiled a shortlist of five trends we’ve seen emerge recently. In a nutshell, it’s all about solving problems for the end user.\\nThe growing popularity of Agile has created more opportunities for full-stack developers.\\nFirst, what is Agile? In a nutshell, it’s a set of management practices that allows software developers to write code and build products more efficiently.\\nAgile has gained serious ground in IT departments across a variety of industries, from finance to food service. While Agile doesn’t explicitly require a team of full-stack developers, it does ask developers to be fully engaged in all facets of building an application, from creating user stories to deployment. As a result, roles on an Agile team start to blur, and each individual winds up working on features across the tech stack.=\\nThere’s no doubt that a team of specialized front-end and back-end developers can build great software. However, today’s hiring managers seem to have a preference for full-stack developers, or at least those who understand both sides of a given tech stack, because these well-rounded employees have a leg up on others in an Agile environment.\\nGood software development leverages design thinking across the stack to benefit the end user.\\nStructure and efficiency are still important for software engineers to get right, but more and more, it’s critical for developers to code across the stack with the end user at top of mind. In fact, Agile teams dedicate time to create user stories that inform the products they build, and each team member is involved in a recurring (or iterative) design process.\\nTim Brown, the CEO of international design firm IDEO, says, “Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.”\\nSoftware is everywhere these days, and it’s not just for techies. Solutions need to be slick, innovative, and easy-to-use. The latest version of iOS or Android needs to be impressive enough for tech enthusiasts to get excited about and straightforward enough for grandpa to check his voicemail. Most importantly, good developers realize those two things aren’t mutually exclusive.\\nJavaScript takes candidates further than ever before.\\nNow more than ever, a strong understanding of JavaScript can really help software developers land a great job.\\nOnce a fairly basic, client-side scripting language, JavaScript has made powerful gains in functionality while staying lean and efficient. In recent years, Node.js, a server-side runtime, has transformed JavaScript into a full-stack powerhouse.\\nJavaScript continues to deliver on the front-end, too: React.js has revolutionized user interface development and has become the front-end JavaScript framework of choice for Fortune 500 companies and startups alike.\\nDiverse and non-traditional candidates are in the spotlight.\\nDiversity in tech remains elusive and persists as a key talking point in the industry. Women, as well as black, Latinx, and LGBT workers, remain severely underrepresented. In light of this year’s high-profile headlines on gender diversity issues at Uber and Google, many tech companies have doubled down on their commitments to boost workplace equality and employ people who authentically empathize with a diverse group of end users.\\nWe’ve also noticed a growing trend toward diversity initiatives that aim to include nontraditional hires like military veterans, career changers, and candidates without four-year degrees. For example, the Microsoft LEAP initiative seeks candidates who have tech experience but may have been out of work for a while (e.g., stay-at-home moms or dads) or career changers with at least six months of software development experience.\\nStrong problem-solving skills remain the common denominator among great developers, and interviewers know it.\\nThis is less of a hiring trend than it is a skill that employers continue to require of all new developers, especially non-traditional hires who may not have a computer science degree or years of experience.\\nSoftware developers – especially those new to the field – are in a constant state of learning new technologies and solving problems they’ve never encountered before. The ability to define a problem, recognize key inputs, and identify potential solutions is particularly important when the quality of a line of code depends on the developer’s ability to think logically and efficiently.\\nInterviewers often ask candidates to walk through a scenario, usually a past experience or a hypothetical case study, where the candidate needs to demonstrate their ability to assess a problem and formulate a solution. Sometimes these questions can be technical and quantitative, other times they’re more behavioral, but either way, it’s clear that companies want employees who think well on their feet and come to their managers with solutions instead of self-explanatory questions.\\nConclusion: Honing your skills to meet employment trends can help you get a software development job, but first, invest in learning the fundamentals of programming.\\nBeyond these trends, employers continue to look for one thing above all else: technical skills! Before learning a new JavaScript framework and doing research on best practices for design thinking, you’ve got to have the fundamentals of software development under your belt. That’s where Codeup comes in. Our 18-week career accelerator gives you all the tools and training you need to capitalize on these trends and land a great job as a software developer.\\nTo learn more about Codeup, email us at info@codeup.com or apply today!\\n\\xa0\\n',\n",

       "  'original': '\\nWhat Makes a Successful Software Developer?\\n\\xa0\\n4 questions to ask yourself when considering a career as a Software Developer.\\nWritten by Dimitri Antoniou\\nSoftware developers build the programs, games, and apps that run on your computer, cell-phone, tablet, video-game system or e-reader. A software developer can be front-end, back-end or full-stack.\\nSuccessful software developers come from diverse backgrounds and a variety of industries. Here at Codeup, our job is to advance existing careers and launch new ones. That means we’ve seen it all. We’ve learned that being a successful software developer comes from the right combination of personality traits and technical knowledge. We’ve gathered a few questions to ask yourself if you are considering becoming a software developer.\\n#1: Do I like working with computers?\\nYou will spend your time building, improving and maintaining different types of software across different pieces of technology. This means that working with computers, phones & tablets should be something you enjoy. This might sound obvious, but it’s huge! We often meet students who are attracted to tech because of exciting new products, collaborative work environments, and flexible schedules. These are all awesome perks, but remember that the most important piece of your work will be the code itself. A software developer spends the majority of their time fixing problems and building frameworks.\\n#2: Do I love to learn?\\nTechnology is a constantly evolving industry. While one language is hot today, it might die tomorrow. Our co-founder, Jason Straughan, often reminisces about writing an entire book on a language that disappeared from use by the time the book was published. What does that mean for you? You should love the process of learning new skills and keeping up to date with cutting-edge technologies. A career in technology gives you the opportunity to reinvent yourself many times. You may love working with databases today and find that UI/UX is where your strengths are in a year. You will need to be able to adapt to changes in the industry and be willing to learn on the job or put in the hours on your own time. The more programming languages under your belt the more value you will be able to provide during every stage of your career.\\n#3: Am I gritty?\\nGrit is a character trait that can make or break long-term success. Psychologist Angela Duckworth explains it as, “Passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina…sticking with your future, day in and day out.” When it comes to software development, having grit means learning from your failures. We’ve seen students struggle not because they can’t figure out the content, but because they are afraid of failing. Move past that fear! You will inevitably make mistakes, but our successful students are those that learn from their failure along the way.\\n#4: Am I a problem-solver?\\nAt the end of the day, code is designed to solve a problem! Your ability to think logically, brainstorm creative solutions, proactively research answers, and fill gaps will make you an effective and efficient software developer. That’s why we test for problem-solving ability in our admissions process. Do you like tinkering, Googling, fixing, solving puzzles, and finding your own answers? If you do, you may appreciate the challenges that come along with developing software and debugging code.\\nThese are the questions to ask yourself when making the decision to become a software developer. If you answered yes to these questions, coding could be for you. At Codeup we offer an 18-week career accelerator that will help you get a foot in the industry. Ready to start?

       "  'original': '\\nAlumni Spotlight: Stefanie Young and Lorne Barfield\\n\\xa0\\nStefanie Young and Lorne Barfield are both Codeup grads and the co-founders of Innov8 Place, a website development company. Here, they share their highs, their lows, their experience and their best tips for succeeding during and after the program.\\nPlease give a little introduction about yourself.\\nStefanie: I’m originally from California. I grew up in the Silicon Valley before the days of Google and had a pretty decent handle on free internet via AOL Trial discs, Napster torrenting, and multi-player gaming platforms (before they were cool). Given the mid to late 90’s, I had quite a bit of backlash within the online communities for my gender and my age. I gave up on tech during my early college years when a female professor told me, “there no room for women in the booming tech industry.” I quickly turned to music and language arts and found myself pursuing the long-term degree before leaving for Texas to enter a Japanese Studies program. I had a rude awakening and poor experience when most jobs I was offered were non-technical, non-creative, and extremely repetitive. It wasn’t going to work. My grandfather had always been a firm believer that I was meant for tech, engineering and developing new ideas. After chatting with him about my failed attempts and unhappiness, I decided to give tech another try through coding and entered into the Codeup family. I worked full-time while attending a night class and found myself doubting my abilities from the beginning. During our first project, something clicked and with the help of the instructors, I had a new-found love for problem solving, developing and code. I haven’t turned back since.\\nLorne:\\xa0I’m also from California. \\xa0I hail from Oakland. \\xa0I’m into just about everything. \\xa0I have worked as a high school basketball coach, personal chef, bartender, bouncer, opera singer, paralegal/legal assistant, and dance instructor. \\xa0I love movies and books….I read about 40+ a year. \\xa0I’m into fantasy and sci-fi, but also enjoy reading Deepak Chopra and books about travelogues (which is somewhat funny because I’m terrified of traveling). I’m a hippie, jock, musician, and nerd. I love people and connection and for someone who grew up largely an only child, I’m always out creating new family. \\xa0If something interests me, I pursue it. \\xa0I like to dive into things that I can share with others. \\xa0I’m an avid NBA fan (Go Warriors!) and if you ever want to argue about basketball, I’m game. \\xa0If you want to see me fully free and in my element, put me around music and dancing. Programming puts me back in my Lego days, where I get to be creative and build things. It’s my new adventure. \\n\\nCan you describe your career path and how you got to where you are now? Were you always interested in programming?\\nStefanie: I wasn’t always interested in programming. I had always seen programming as a career that leads to a dark room with smelly individuals, Cheetos and Mountain Dew. I didn’t want to be placed in a cubical and made to work 10 – 16 hour days to complete a project or operating system. Web development when I first set out to learn tech was not a major degree option or talked about much. Browsers were faulty and new to the scene. It was a questionable career path at the time. My grandfather was an engineer with Stanford University and always brought home hardware for PCs. I thought that would be my path as well. I loved building and problem solving the communication errors between parts. Little did I know that programming was that too on a more abstract and dynamic level.\\nLorne: I absolutely thought programming was way out of my range and my experience. \\xa0Nothing about it felt like something I would be into. \\xa0I had simply grown out of my old position and location. \\xa0I was a paralegal in San Francisco and I was no longer challenged. \\xa0I wanted to go back to school or do something new but had no clue what. \\xa0It was too expensive to do there, my parents brought up Codeup (they live here), and here I am. \\n\\nWhy did you look into an immersive program? Why the Codeup experience?\\nStefanie:\\xa0Honestly, I was extremely doubtful of the program, especially after being trained into the thought process that traditional college was the only form of useful education and the only experience one should seek before career searching. It wasn’t until I was trying to break into marketing firms, coding communities and design groups that I was told about the program. Three people approached me and recommended the program. I didn’t listen. Then life started shouting it at me. I saw the billboard… then a marketing card in the mail… and then I heard a friend talking about their acceptance into the program. Finally I gave in and went to the Codeup location.I took a couple of tests and passed with flying colors. I decided to take the leap since they were offering a night program that started after work hours. Since they helped with job placement as well, I took them to be my chance at a better work life.\\nLorne: I was on the verge of going to teach English in Turkey when my parents suggested that I look at Codeup. \\xa0I took the test, not sure if I’d get in, and then when I did, I bought a ticket the next day and the rest is history. \\nWhat was your experience with Codeup?\\nStefanie: Overall, my experience was eye-opening. I did not expect to have young mothers, grandmothers, high school graduates or college graduates with Masters in the same class. The culture was liberating since we were all there for the same reason – to change our paths and achieve new goals. The instructors were very hands on and helped everyone thinking about problem-solving in new ways and how to attempt developing ideas out of nothing. The hardest step was always deciding where to start and finding the confidence to dive in, code first, and prepare to work through your own problems and use the resources available. \\nLorne: Codeup opened my eyes to a new world. \\xa0They made programming and something that seemed so daunting, really fun. \\xa0I never thought I would enjoy it, but the collaborative nature of it and the creative juices that got to come out, made me fall in love with it. \\xa0The instructors, the classroom, everything about it made me feel like I could do it. \\xa0I think that was the largest thing. \\xa0Despite any difficulties or frustrating, I felt empowered…like given time and community, I could solve anything. \\xa0That’s an awesome feeling. \\nHow do you feel Codeup has helped/is helping you grow? Did/How has Codeup’s career services helped you?\\nStefanie: The program taught me independence and confidence. I am more free-thinking than I have ever been. I understand how to think about everyday issues from multiple viewpoints, and I know how to stand my ground and prove my points and way of thinking. I know that it’s okay to be wrong and how to go about admitting it. Even if it seems counterproductive to building independence, I know it’s okay to ask for help.The program also taught me about resourcefulness and communication on a whole new level. These two features alone were enough to land me just about any job. Soft skills are just as important as the hard skills. \\nLorne: It taught me how to break down problems. \\xa0It taught me how to ask for help and that is perfectly right and ok. Codeup gave me my first job, and kind of my second, as I worked for one of the founders as my second. \\xa0They always believe in their students and help them match and grow. \\n\\nAny advice for current and future Codeup Alumni?\\nStefanie: Understand that this program is meant to accelerate your learning of development. You have to be hungry for this knowledge and supplement the curriculum outside of the classroom as well as practicing it. There has to be a drive for the goal ahead. Be willing to sacrifice some of your free time.This class is so much more rewarding if you learn to work as a class unit early on and help each other succeed. Employers will see it in your example work, the projects and want to hear about your ability to communicate and mesh well as a developer. Be open-minded and be willing to be wrong. I learned so much more from being wrong than from being right. Experience is priceless in the long run.\\xa0\\nLorne: Stay patient and humble. \\xa0This world of programming is huge. \\xa0It can be overwhelming. \\xa0Just keep that learner mind and understand that time and keyboard time are your greatest assets. \\xa0\\xa0It may not feel like you’re growing, but then you’ll look up every now and then and realize just how much you know and how far you’ve come. \\xa0It’s a pretty awesome feeling. \\nWhat was the best part of the experience in your opinion?\\nStefanie:\\xa0The staff and fellow classmates made the program great in my eyes. The interactions and experiences of having a new community of people who had similar goals made for a welcoming and productive environment.\\nLorne: I think the greatest part is the classroom. \\xa0The idea that when everyone shares knowledge, everyone succeeds. \\xa0The collaborative power of coding is insane and if there’s anything I can attribute to the rapid rise of technology is that it brought a collective human mind to any problem. \\xa0People from all over the world now have the ability to work together to create brand new things. \\xa0You get your first taste of that in the classroom. \\xa0The sense that everyone wants you to succeed and you can lean on one another to fill in gaps where you may not be the strongest. \\xa0It’s a really amazing feeling.\\n',\n",

       "  'lemmatized': 'Alumni Spotlight: Stefanie Young and Lorne Barfield Stefanie Young and Lorne Barfield are both Codeup grad and the co-founders of Innov8 Place, a website development company. Here, they share their highs, their lows, their experience and their best tip for succeeding during and after the program. Please give a little introduction about yourself. Stefanie: I’m originally from California. I grew up in the Silicon Valley before the day of Google and had a pretty decent handle on free internet via AOL Trial discs, Napster torrenting, and multi-player gaming platform (before they were cool). Given the mid to late 90’s, I had quite a bit of backlash within the online community for my gender and my age. I gave up on tech during my early college year when a female professor told me, “there no room for woman in the booming tech industry.” I quickly turned to music and language art and found myself pursuing the long-term degree before leaving for Texas to enter a Japanese Studies program. I had a rude awakening and poor experience when most job I wa offered were non-technical, non-creative, and extremely repetitive. It wasn’t going to work. My grandfather had always been a firm believer that I wa meant for tech, engineering and developing new ideas. After chatting with him about my failed attempt and unhappiness, I decided to give tech another try through coding and entered into the Codeup family. I worked full-time while attending a night class and found myself doubting my ability from the beginning. During our first project, something clicked and with the help of the instructors, I had a new-found love for problem solving, developing and code. I haven’t turned back since. Lorne: I’m also from California. I hail from Oakland. I’m into just about everything. I have worked a a high school basketball coach, personal chef, bartender, bouncer, opera singer, paralegal/legal assistant, and dance instructor. I love movie and books….I read about 40+ a year. I’m into fantasy and sci-fi, but also enjoy reading Deepak Chopra and book about travelogue (which is somewhat funny because I’m terrified of traveling). I’m a hippie, jock, musician, and nerd. I love people and connection and for someone who grew up largely an only child, I’m always out creating new family. If something interest me, I pursue it. I like to dive into thing that I can share with others. I’m an avid NBA fan (Go Warriors!) and if you ever want to argue about basketball, I’m game. If you want to see me fully free and in my element, put me around music and dancing. Programming put me back in my Lego days, where I get to be creative and build things. It’s my new adventure. Can you describe your career path and how you got to where you are now? Were you always interested in programming? Stefanie: I wasn’t always interested in programming. I had always seen programming a a career that lead to a dark room with smelly individuals, Cheetos and Mountain Dew. I didn’t want to be placed in a cubical and made to work 10 – 16 hour day to complete a project or operating system. Web development when I first set out to learn tech wa not a major degree option or talked about much. Browsers were faulty and new to the scene. It wa a questionable career path at the time. My grandfather wa an engineer with Stanford University and always brought home hardware for PCs. I thought that would be my path a well. I loved building and problem solving the communication error between parts. Little did I know that programming wa that too on a more abstract and dynamic level. Lorne: I absolutely thought programming wa way out of my range and my experience. Nothing about it felt like something I would be into. I had simply grown out of my old position and location. I wa a paralegal in San Francisco and I wa no longer challenged. I wanted to go back to school or do something new but had no clue what. It wa too expensive to do there, my parent brought up Codeup (they live here), and here I am. Why did you look into an immersive program? Why the Codeup experience? Stefanie: Honestly, I wa extremely doubtful of the program, especially after being trained into the thought process that traditional college wa the only form of useful education and the only experience one should seek before career searching. It wasn’t until I wa trying to break into marketing firms, coding community and design group that I wa told about the program. Three people approached me and recommended the program. I didn’t listen. Then life started shouting it at me. I saw the billboard… then a marketing card in the mail… and then I heard a friend talking about their acceptance into the program. Finally I gave in and went to the Codeup location.I took a couple of test and passed with flying colors. I decided to take the leap since they were offering a night program that started after work hours. Since they helped with job placement a well, I took them to be my chance at a better work life. Lorne: I wa on the verge of going to teach English in Turkey when my parent suggested that I look at Codeup. I took the test, not sure if I’d get in, and then when I did, I bought a ticket the next day and the rest is history. What wa your experience with Codeup? Stefanie: Overall, my experience wa eye-opening. I did not expect to have young mothers, grandmothers, high school graduate or college graduate with Masters in the same class. The culture wa liberating since we were all there for the same reason – to change our path and achieve new goals. The instructor were very hand on and helped everyone thinking about problem-solving in new way and how to attempt developing idea out of nothing. The hardest step wa always deciding where to start and finding the confidence to dive in, code first, and prepare to work through your own problem and use the resource available. Lorne: Codeup opened my eye to a new world. They made programming and something that seemed so daunting, really fun. I never thought I would enjoy it, but the collaborative nature of it and the creative juice that got to come out, made me fall in love with it. The instructors, the classroom, everything about it made me feel like I could do it. I think that wa the largest thing. Despite any difficulty or frustrating, I felt empowered…like given time and community, I could solve anything. That’s an awesome feeling. How do you feel Codeup ha helped/is helping you grow? Did/How ha Codeup’s career service helped you? Stefanie: The program taught me independence and confidence. I am more free-thinking than I have ever been. I understand how to think about everyday issue from multiple viewpoints, and I know how to stand my ground and prove my point and way of thinking. I know that it’s okay to be wrong and how to go about admitting it. Even if it seems counterproductive to building independence, I know it’s okay to ask for help.The program also taught me about resourcefulness and communication on a whole new level. These two feature alone were enough to land me just about any job. Soft skill are just a important a the hard skills. Lorne: It taught me how to break down problems. It taught me how to ask for help and that is perfectly right and ok. Codeup gave me my first job, and kind of my second, a I worked for one of the founder a my second. They always believe in their student and help them match and grow. Any advice for current and future Codeup Alumni? Stefanie: Understand that this program is meant to accelerate your learning of development. You have to be hungry for this knowledge and supplement the curriculum outside of the classroom a well a practicing it. There ha to be a drive for the goal ahead. Be willing to sacrifice some of your free time.This class is so much more rewarding if you learn to work a a class unit early on and help each other succeed. Employers will see it in your example work, the project and want to hear about your ability to communicate and mesh well a a developer. Be open-minded and be willing to be wrong. I learned so much more from being wrong than from being right. Experience is priceless in the long run. Lorne: Stay patient and humble. This world of programming is huge. It can be overwhelming. Just keep that learner mind and understand that time and keyboard time are your greatest assets. It may not feel like you’re growing, but then you’ll look up every now and then and realize just how much you know and how far you’ve come. It’s a pretty awesome feeling. What wa the best part of the experience in your opinion? Stefanie: The staff and fellow classmate made the program great in my eyes. The interaction and experience of having a new community of people who had similar goal made for a welcoming and productive environment. Lorne: I think the greatest part is the classroom. The idea that when everyone share knowledge, everyone succeeds. The collaborative power of coding is insane and if there’s anything I can attribute to the rapid rise of technology is that it brought a collective human mind to any problem. People from all over the world now have the ability to work together to create brand new things. You get your first taste of that in the classroom. The sense that everyone want you to succeed and you can lean on one another to fill in gap where you may not be the strongest. It’s a really amazing feeling.',\n",

       "  'original': '\\nAlumni Spotlight: Mary-Kaitlin (MK) Warren\\nFrom being an Assistant Manager at Entreprise Rent-A-Car to becoming a stellar programmer, MK shares her path that led her to where she is now—a student in the Microsoft LEAP program.\\nCan you describe your career story and how you got to where you are right now?\\n Random. My senior year of high school, I started watching Bones and first heard of Anthropology. So I majored in Anthropology. I also majored in German, because I wanted a back up plan in case I decided not to go to grad school for Anthropology, and everybody knows that companies are fighting over German majors. The spring semester of my senior year, I had no plan and my family told me that I needed to get a job, so I hit up Monster and applied to Enterprise’s Management Training program. Randomly, I got the job. After 2 years I decided I didn’t want to do that for the rest of my life. I got on Monster (I should send them a card) and randomly found Codeup. I think it was an ad? Pretty sure I didn’t know what a bootcamp was at the time. After that, it gets less random and more Codeup driven. My first job after Codeup was with a company that had come to my Demo Day. The job after that was with a company that came to do onsite interviews at Codeup. I found out about my current opportunity through Codeup as well. So… three cheers (or jobs) for Codeup!\\nHow do you think your past has brought you here to Codeup?\\n I had taken a computer science class in high school and done well. When I was looking to transition out of the customer service/sales realm, I knew that I wanted a set of hard skills, and luckily Codeup offered a place to grow those.\\nThere are a lot of options out there for learning to code. Why Codeup?\\xa0\\n I thought about trying to do something online, like CodeAcademy, but I ended up going with Codeup because of the connections. Where as DIYing your coding education is possible, it’s hard to get your resume through the door if you have no professional experience. Codeup helped make initial connections that have propelled me into the career that I want. Also, I am terrible at making myself watch videos online.\\nWhat got you hooked on programming or the idea of moving into the tech space?\\n I am drawn to programming because there is an answer. If your code doesn’t compile, there is a reason (and probably a silly one at that). It was a nice change of pace coming from a liberal arts background, where things are a little less black and white.\\nWhat are some things you like about Codeup?\\xa0\\n Definitely the snacks.\\nWhat would you change/want to see us do differently?\\n It’s hard for a coding school to do this, because it is a business, but a little more clarity upfront about the types of positions to expect (especially in a market like San Antonio), would have been nice. Part of the reason why I decided to do Codeup was the claim that graduates made 15k more afterwards, and so I took out the loan for 15k with the idea that I could pay it back in less than a year. A month in, I realized that the average graduate salary was about 15k less than I was making, so that was a little disappointing and cause some numbers shuffling. Again, I know that’s kind of a hard thing to change, but it’s the only suggestion that I have. Everything else was pretty good.\\nWhat are your plans after Codeup, both in the immediate and long term?\\nWell, speaking in hindsight, short term was to get paid to program and get some experience on my resume. Long term is to move into a tech arch role, change the world with some awesome software and/or hardware, and become Tony Stark.\\nA lot of people don’t think of SA as being a vibrant city for Society of Women Engineers (SWE). What have you seen in terms of the city, people, events, etc. that contradict this idea?\\xa0\\nWe’re on the comeup.\\n\\xa0I would say that San Antonio has a lot of companies that have very robust SWE communities that exist outside of the Downtown/Houston street epicenter. I think that because of the geography of San Antonio (read: sprawl), it is harder to see than a place like Austin or Seattle.\\nWhat are some of the things minorities, disenfranchised and marginalized groups need to know about the support, or lack thereof, within Codeup?\\n Codeup is there to support you. Practically speaking, their success is your success. Aside from that, everyone there is super supportive and just generally nice. If you aren’t understanding a topic, the instructors are willing to help and walk you through it (even on their lunch break. WOW!!!).\\nWhat would you say to these groups of people who are on the fence about joining a bootcamp due to lack of diversity, inclusivity, and overall fear of not having the support that they would need?\\n This is a bit tricky. I would say that first and foremost, know you’re own truth. Software isn’t for everyone, so have that moment of honesty where you decide if you are doing this because you like the idea of programming every day, or because you like the idea of a 6 figure salary in 4 months and working from home everyday (spoiler alert: highly unlikely for your first, or dare I say, second programming job). If you are passionate about building software for the rest of your life, I honestly believe that Codeup is the best place to start that journey. The community is incredible; the instructors are amazeballs; the staff is incredibly supportive; and the founders are boss *** hustlers. It truly is the best place to start your development journey in San Antonio. (P.S. if you are from out of town, forget Codeup. Come to San Antonio for the breakfast tacos, and stay for Codeup.)\\nHow’d you find out about the LEAP program and what are some of the reasons for wanting to participate?\\n Dylan sent out an email with some information about the program, and it seemed like an awesome opportunity. If you don’t major in CS, there aren’t a lot of opportunities to “intern” for the Microsofts/Googles/Facebooks of the world. LEAP is awesome, because it gives you that same foot in the door that an internship gives, even if you didn’t go the traditional Computer Science route. (Also: Seattle weather, multitude of hiking trails, coffee).\\nLEAP is an incredible opportunity! What are you planning on doing after completing the program?\\n Keep learning. Become Tony Stark.\\nAnything else you would like to talk about regarding the Career Services and Development through Codeup?\\n c:\\\\myPath. In other words, Codeup’s Career Services and Development has gotten me 3/3 gigs. That goes to show that just because you get your first job, doesn’t mean that you are out of the family.\\n',\n",

       "  'lemmatized': 'Alumni Spotlight: Mary-Kaitlin (MK) Warren From being an Assistant Manager at Entreprise Rent-A-Car to becoming a stellar programmer, MK share her path that led her to where she is now—a student in the Microsoft LEAP program. Can you describe your career story and how you got to where you are right now? Random. My senior year of high school, I started watching Bones and first heard of Anthropology. So I majored in Anthropology. I also majored in German, because I wanted a back up plan in case I decided not to go to grad school for Anthropology, and everybody know that company are fighting over German majors. The spring semester of my senior year, I had no plan and my family told me that I needed to get a job, so I hit up Monster and applied to Enterprise’s Management Training program. Randomly, I got the job. After 2 year I decided I didn’t want to do that for the rest of my life. I got on Monster (I should send them a card) and randomly found Codeup. I think it wa an ad? Pretty sure I didn’t know what a bootcamp wa at the time. After that, it get le random and more Codeup driven. My first job after Codeup wa with a company that had come to my Demo Day. The job after that wa with a company that came to do onsite interview at Codeup. I found out about my current opportunity through Codeup a well. So… three cheer (or jobs) for Codeup! How do you think your past ha brought you here to Codeup? I had taken a computer science class in high school and done well. When I wa looking to transition out of the customer service/sales realm, I knew that I wanted a set of hard skills, and luckily Codeup offered a place to grow those. There are a lot of option out there for learning to code. Why Codeup? I thought about trying to do something online, like CodeAcademy, but I ended up going with Codeup because of the connections. Where a DIYing your coding education is possible, it’s hard to get your resume through the door if you have no professional experience. Codeup helped make initial connection that have propelled me into the career that I want. Also, I am terrible at making myself watch video online. What got you hooked on programming or the idea of moving into the tech space? I am drawn to programming because there is an answer. If your code doesn’t compile, there is a reason (and probably a silly one at that). It wa a nice change of pace coming from a liberal art background, where thing are a little le black and white. What are some thing you like about Codeup? Definitely the snacks. What would you change/want to see u do differently? It’s hard for a coding school to do this, because it is a business, but a little more clarity upfront about the type of position to expect (especially in a market like San Antonio), would have been nice. Part of the reason why I decided to do Codeup wa the claim that graduate made 15k more afterwards, and so I took out the loan for 15k with the idea that I could pay it back in le than a year. A month in, I realized that the average graduate salary wa about 15k le than I wa making, so that wa a little disappointing and cause some number shuffling. Again, I know that’s kind of a hard thing to change, but it’s the only suggestion that I have. Everything else wa pretty good. What are your plan after Codeup, both in the immediate and long term? Well, speaking in hindsight, short term wa to get paid to program and get some experience on my resume. Long term is to move into a tech arch role, change the world with some awesome software and/or hardware, and become Tony Stark. A lot of people don’t think of SA a being a vibrant city for Society of Women Engineers (SWE). What have you seen in term of the city, people, events, etc. that contradict this idea? We’re on the comeup. I would say that San Antonio ha a lot of company that have very robust SWE community that exist outside of the Downtown/Houston street epicenter. I think that because of the geography of San Antonio (read: sprawl), it is harder to see than a place like Austin or Seattle. What are some of the thing minorities, disenfranchised and marginalized group need to know about the support, or lack thereof, within Codeup? Codeup is there to support you. Practically speaking, their success is your success. Aside from that, everyone there is super supportive and just generally nice. If you aren’t understanding a topic, the instructor are willing to help and walk you through it (even on their lunch break. WOW!!!). What would you say to these group of people who are on the fence about joining a bootcamp due to lack of diversity, inclusivity, and overall fear of not having the support that they would need? This is a bit tricky. I would say that first and foremost, know you’re own truth. Software isn’t for everyone, so have that moment of honesty where you decide if you are doing this because you like the idea of programming every day, or because you like the idea of a 6 figure salary in 4 month and working from home everyday (spoiler alert: highly unlikely for your first, or dare I say, second programming job). If you are passionate about building software for the rest of your life, I honestly believe that Codeup is the best place to start that journey. The community is incredible; the instructor are amazeballs; the staff is incredibly supportive; and the founder are bos *** hustlers. It truly is the best place to start your development journey in San Antonio. (P.S. if you are from out of town, forget Codeup. Come to San Antonio for the breakfast tacos, and stay for Codeup.) How’d you find out about the LEAP program and what are some of the reason for wanting to participate? Dylan sent out an email with some information about the program, and it seemed like an awesome opportunity. If you don’t major in CS, there aren’t a lot of opportunity to “intern” for the Microsofts/Googles/Facebooks of the world. LEAP is awesome, because it give you that same foot in the door that an internship gives, even if you didn’t go the traditional Computer Science route. (Also: Seattle weather, multitude of hiking trails, coffee). LEAP is an incredible opportunity! What are you planning on doing after completing the program? Keep learning. Become Tony Stark. Anything else you would like to talk about regarding the Career Services and Development through Codeup? c:\\\\myPath. In other words, Codeup’s Career Services and Development ha gotten me 3/3 gigs. That go to show that just because you get your first job, doesn’t mean that you are out of the family.',\n",

So what can students do instead?\\nForbes Magazine ranked San Antonio as the American city with the 15th highest rate of job growth in 2015 – no surprise given our city’s recent swell in tech and entrepreneurship. The boom has created a mismatch between a surplus of available jobs for developers and a shortage of local technical talent. Codeup, a career accelerator for new software developers, has begun bridging that gap by training 267 developers and creating $5.8 million in new tech salaries since 2013. \\nCodeup is different from traditional models of continued education. Four-year universities and two-year technical schools often no longer serve students’ needs. The recent closure of ITT Tech, one of the nation’s largest for-profit educational institutions, is a great example. Tuition at schools like ITT Tech, DeVry, and Kaplan is high ($45,000 – $90,000), they have been found to use predatory lending practices, and they rank highest among colleges that leave students in the most debt. Graduates of ITT Tech San Antonio who received federal financial aid earned an average salary of only $38,400 ten years after completion, just barely above the national average for the category. Their overwhelming time commitment, high tuition fees, and limited career support make it hard for students to complete degrees and advance their careers. \\nITT Tech Closes, Another Door Opens…\\nGiven the decline of these diploma mills and a changing jobscape, other forms of education have exploded. The new reality is that the traditional college student archetype is now a minority, while demands for alternative, dynamic educational models are only increasing. Students need a better way to enter the workforce with relevant technical skills. \\xa0\\nAs a four-month intensive career accelerator, Codeup offers something special: a place where students can find like-minded peers and launch a new career. Our classroom-based program turns non-techies into software developers. In addition to excellent technical instruction, students receive one-on-one career guidance and gain opportunities to connect with employers. If a graduate cannot find employment within 6 months, Codeup offers a tuition back guarantee. We partner with multiple reputable loan and grant partners to make financing easy, and also accepts GI benefits. Graduates have increased their salary by $17K in the first year on average. \\nIn light of the recent closings of ITT Tech across the country, students should pause to reconsider their educational path choices.

       "  'original': '\\n6 Tips For Picking The Best Coding Bootcamp\\nHaving a tough time choosing the best coding bootcamp\\xa0for you? Not sure whether the bootcamp\\xa0you’ve just been admitted to is legit?\\nWell, you’re in luck!\\nAs Codeup‘s admissions director, I speak to dozens of current and prospective students everyday. I’m here to help cut through the noise and\\xa0share feedback from those students, and help you on your path to picking the best coding bootcamp for you.\\nProgram fit and quality are key to launching a successful\\xa0career as a software developer, and there are six non-negotiables to keep in mind as you make your decision.\\n6 Tips For Picking the Best Coding Bootcamp (TL;DR)\\n\\nLearn from the pros. Be\\xa0sure you’ll have lots of access to experienced, passionate\\xa0instructors.\\nQuality over quantity.\\xa0Be wary of schools\\xa0with lots of campuses. You don’t want to end up at a diploma mill!\\nIn-person, not online!\\xa0Schools with in-person\\xa0learning environments produce\\xa0better programmers.\\nDo they put their money where their mouth is? Check out the school’s job placement opportunities and/or job guarantee.\\nNetworking! Ask about how the school gets students\\xa0integrated in the local tech community.\\nKeep an eye on funding options, especially those from non-profit sources. Even if you don’t qualify for a grant or scholarship, it means the school has been vetted by third parties.\\n\\n1. Lots of 1:1\\xa0Time with Qualified, Experienced Instructors\\nWe’ve all dealt with disengaged teachers, but at a good program, you shouldn’t have to. Be sure that there’s a full staff of bona fide instructors that maximize individual attention and mutual accountability.\\nLook for three things in your programming instruction: actual work experience in the industry (not just at the bootcamp!), a passion for teaching, and access to one-on-one tutoring.\\nCollege computer science courses are heavy on theory, light on useful applications. That’s great for some folks, but a good immersive coding program gives you the tools you need to get a job, and it’s best to learn from people who’ve been using them to build creations\\xa0of their own. When reviewing instructors’ credentials, look past the fancy degrees and give brownie points for web development jobs and industry savvy.\\nWith that in mind, some of the most\\xa0brilliant software developers\\xa0simply aren’t the greatest teachers. You want to be sure your instructors love interacting with students, explaining\\xa0complex concepts to beginners, and offering one-on-one help whenever needed.\\nAlso, when possible, be sure to do a campus visit and meet the instructional staff. The program staff should always be open to this.\\n2. Fewer\\xa0Locations = Higher\\xa0Quality\\nAlright, I’ll say it. Be wary of coding schools with multiple campuses. Some bootcamps are\\xa0decent in one city and terrible in another. It’s much easier for a program\\xa0to give you quality, individualized attention when the staff and instructors aren’t answering to people in a different time zone.\\nThere’s decades of evidence for this.\\xa0The country’s best universities hunker down in one spot and focus on student success. Money-hungry diploma mills have locations in strip malls from coast-to-coast, some of which are known for high dropout rates and have been banned from recruiting military personnel. As with any decision in higher ed,\\xa0choosing a focused coding bootcamp makes all the difference.\\n3. Immersion\\nYou’ve probably heard people compare learning programming to learning\\xa0spoken languages. There are lots of similarities, but there’s a big one\\xa0to keep in mind: immersion. Both types of languages are learned best through using the language all day, every day, with other people, for an extended period of time.\\nA coding bootcamp worth your time\\xa0should provide a collaborative environment that immerses you in code. You’ll be able to sharpen your new skills alongside a team of experts and vetted fellow students. Instructors push you to the next level, and when the going gets tough, you can always ask one of your bright classmates—a whole group of bright classmates, in fact!\\n4. A Stellar Job Placement Record\\nWhat’s the end game of any good coding program? Getting you a well-paid job at a company you like!\\nFirst, check out the schools’s job placement rate. If their admissions strategy and teaching are solid, it should be north of 90% over six months. This means they’re accepting students who will succeed as developers, not just anyone who can pay the tuition.\\nNext, take a look at the list of companies where alumni take jobs. Are they all funneled into one industry? What’s the ratio of startups to corporations? A diverse set of post-grad placements suggests you’ll learn the programming skills necessary to succeed in any work environment.\\nAlso, make sure the school\\xa0is willing to put its money where its mouth is. Good programs should guarantee you a job in a timely fashion or else give you a significant refund.\\nWould you rather start something of your own? Even better! Keep reading below.\\n5. Ecosystem, Ecosystem, Ecosystem\\nThe tech industry thrives in areas where entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and developers—i.e., you!—can easily get together and make the magic happen.\\nCollaborative workspaces, like Geekdom in San Antonio, allow entrepreneurs to build new business and products together. Notable local tech companies like Rackspace and top-tier startup accelerators are also key indicators of a healthy ecosystem and provide important funding sources for new ventures. Cities with diverse, technology-heavy industries (e.g., healthcare, military, energy, aeronautics, automotive, and advanced manufacturing) also offer a strong commercial base to support tech entrepreneurs and job seekers.\\nAs you start to build things, it’s also nice to be in a somewhat smaller ecosystem. Getting in on\\xa0the ground floor of a growing\\xa0tech scene gives you access\\xa0to willing and able mentors. Smaller tech cities also tend to have\\xa0lower costs of living. A new software engineer often finds it helpful to be a big fish in a friendly, easy-to-navigate pond, where the tech community’s got her back in times of success and failure.\\n6.\\xa0Ample Funding Options\\nKeep an eye out for schools with various funding options. Many offer loans that allow students to defer payments until after graduation. That’s a huge\\xa0plus, but you should also ask about\\xa0non-profit tuition grants\\xa0and scholarships. And should you not qualify for these benefits, at least you can rest assured that third parties have vetted your school and its leadership is serious increasing access to education.\\nSo…which coding bootcamp is right for you?\\nImmersive coding programs can get you started on an exciting new career path. That said, big life transitions aren’t easy. It’s important to find the right program, and we encourage all applicants to\\xa0vet their options\\xa0for how well each school\\xa0teaches and accommodates their students.\\nIf you have any questions or comments about Codeup, or anything else, we’d love to hear from you! Please feel free to\\xa0send an email to info@codeup.com or schedule a phone call.\\xa0We’ll be in touch shortly.\\n',\n",

       "  'original': '\\nA Guide to Hiring Fresh Technical Talent\\nWe’ve watched many employers learn how to hire fresh technical talent since we started Codeup in 2013. Now that many of our grads have 18+ months of work experience, we spoke to employers to determine best practices for hiring Codeup grads. We saw some common themes that can help other employers. Here’s what they said.\\nClassical tech interviewing techniques (“Solve this problem without recursion on this whiteboard while we stare at you!”) aren’t always as useful.\\n\\n“You must understand that this is a junior dev and probably has less than a year of coding experience. You must interview for aptitude and attitude. I usually perform at least 2-3 interviews, starting out with a behavioral interview, then perform a programming and problem solving interview. I usually ask a question that is not solvable (in the allotted time of the interview). I do this on purpose to see how they manage tough problems and difficult situations, from both an intellectual and emotional perspective.”\\n“The best practice is always to have the grads interview with different people in the team. Each person assess one specific area of expertise. So we normally have three interviews focus on each of the following aspects:\\n\\nPersonality and cultural fit (previous projects/jobs, experience, drive, motivation, likes and dislikes, strengths and soft skills)\\nCoding Assessment (In this one we try to simulate a work environment in which the interviewer is already part of the team and helps us come up with a feature/solution for a specific customer request. We go over analysis, database design, some white board coding for specific functions and sometimes even GUI design)\\nTechnical Assessment. Questions are asked about specific technologies and also we like to focus on their capstone project and what role/part they had during its development. We evaluate how well they can explain their project and the tasks that they performed.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHiring fresh talent requires a different mindset and approach to growing a tech organization.\\n\\n“Early on we put new grads on pet projects – usually something internal that was a contrived project. We quickly discovered that real world projects were a much better starting point. Typically we have them start with writing automated tests, then slowly give them more demanding work as their skill sets develop.”\\n“Be honest with yourself about what your needs are and what your company is hiring for. Bootcamp grads need mentorship and time to develop and progress within an organization.”\\n\\nAn experienced mentor and development plan are essential.\\n\\n“Understand that you are making an investment. If you make a wise selection and couple that with strong mentorship you can end up with great talent.”\\n“Pairing an entry-level developer with more experienced team members has worked well for us. We also like to get our newly graduated developers into real code as soon as possible. There is no better way to learn than solid keyboard time.”\\n“What has worked best so far is to get them into support tasks immediately, so\\xa0they get familiar with the code, the architecture, the product and the customers and the learning curve, although a little more aggressive, is reduced. This way while fixing bugs or doing QA they learn the most complex and hidden parts of our system which triggers the right questions.“\\n\\nSmart management and hiring approaches still apply.\\n\\n“Providing a mix of focused assignments within their skills set along with some stretch assignments and mentorship maximizes their development.“\\n“Having an onboarding plan is a must with 1 month, 3 month, 6 month targets. Provide the developer with tutorials and find assignments where the tools and knowledge that they have at a particular point will allow them to succeed at completing such assignment. Furthermore, weekly 1:1’s are crucial.”\\n“With one of my hires, even though I didn’t feel very strong in their ability, I hired based on attitude with a hope that over time, they would become a better developer. I found that they (again because of their attitude) excelled with customer support, so they found their place there instead of development.”\\n\\nEntry-level talent can positively impact team attitudes and fulfilment amongst senior staff\\n\\n“Having entry-level people can be a great way to add energy to a team, and allows more senior developers the opportunity to mentor and teach their craft to others.”\\n\\nWe’d love to see how we can help your company grow its tech talent pipeline.

       "  'original': '\\nCodeup Helps Rails Girls Help Women Learn to Code in San Antonio\\nThis moment in history is exploding with stories about women breaking new ground in technology, summits of female tech leaders, and invitations for women to learn new technology skills so that IT teams and development shops can benefit from gender parity. Organizations like Rails Girls are fueling the fire by providing women and girls with the tools and community they need to learn, and to be confident with new coding skills. This week, Rails Girls is putting on a free, two-day workshop in San Antonio where they will teach women how to program using Ruby on Rails.\\nAt Codeup, we’re all about community, collaboration, and partnership. It’s our lifeblood to be an integrated force in San Antonio’s landscape of blooming, new tech talent. We also work to fuel the dreams, goals and future potential of women in tech careers. So when we heard about the upcoming Rails Girls workshop, we only had one question, which we managed to sandwich between our fangirl squeals: Can we partner with you?!\\n\\xa0\\nThey said yes, we cried tears of joy, and our shared mission has us both super invested in the success of the upcoming workshop. How are we investing? Well, our time, treasure, and talent are the best things we can give! Two of our esteemed team members, an instructor and one of our curriculum developers, as well as our co-founder and his team of developers, will be participating as on-site mentors to help facilitate the learning process. As educators and friends, these folks embody who we are and what we do at Codeup. Here’s their take on the weekend’s programming festivities:\\nRyan Orsinger, our full-stack bootcamp instructor, says, “Rails Girls makes a global impact for gender parity in the programming community. Codeup makes an impact for gender parity in the San Antonio programming community.” It’s a perfect match of shared goals!\\nRyan goes on to say that his “decision to volunteer as a coach for Rails Girls is simple. Programming is the new literacy, and everyone should have exposure and experience in this field. I’m thrilled that San Antonio will be hosting its first (of many) Rails Girls workshops.” \\xa0\\xa0Agreed, Ryan.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nNow, meet Tarek Hafez, a curriculum developer here at Codeup:\\nTarek is passionate about learning and growing from the challenges he faces, and as a volunteer at Rails Girls he hopes to share his passion and knowledge with others. “I can help to motivate and inspire those I seek to mentor, as well as educate,” said Tarek, “I could not ask for a better opportunity.”\\n\\xa0\\nAnother awesome supporter of Rails Girls from our community is Jason Straughan, a Codeup cofounder, our CTO, and founder and head guy in charge of everything at a Grok Interactive, a web application development company. He’s sending his developers to also mentor the event.\\n“Louis, Anton, and Joseph and I are going to be coaches for Rails Girls…I’m pumped,” said Josh Freeman, senior software developer and former instructor for Codeup teen summer coding camps. Not only that, Joseph is a also Codeup-grad-turned-Grok-developer! According to Josh, the developers at Grok are never done learning and studying, an ideal that “meshes well with Rails Girls, where you’re trying to train and introduce new people to programming. That’s why we jumped at the opportunity.” Although the Rails Girls workshop will only be in San Antonio for a weekend, the organization has already planted its compelling, and contagious, vision in our city.\\nIn our coding bootcamps people come in with dreams, hopes, fears, and wonder. Can I do this? Can I really learn a new set of skills in four months, become a valuable developer, and end up with a completely new job, new life, and new trajectory? And women especially bring a different set of sensitivity and caution. We meet their wise concerns with a great confidence-building foundation of real skills to maximize their value in the tech landscape. Can I really do this? Is there room for me in the 73% tech industry? Can I make a difference?\\nGreat questions. And we answer them with a resounding yes because we see it happen again, and again, and again.\\n*You may still be able to snag a spot at this weekend’s workshop!

Organizations like Rails Girls are fueling the fire by providing woman and girl with the tool and community they need to learn, and to be confident with new coding skills. This week, Rails Girls is putting on a free, two-day workshop in San Antonio where they will teach woman how to program using Ruby on Rails. At Codeup, we’re all about community, collaboration, and partnership. It’s our lifeblood to be an integrated force in San Antonio’s landscape of blooming, new tech talent. We also work to fuel the dreams, goal and future potential of woman in tech careers. So when we heard about the upcoming Rails Girls workshop, we only had one question, which we managed to sandwich between our fangirl squeals: Can we partner with you?! They said yes, we cried tear of joy, and our shared mission ha u both super invested in the success of the upcoming workshop. How are we investing? Well, our time, treasure, and talent are the best thing we can give! Two of our esteemed team members, an instructor and one of our curriculum developers, a well a our co-founder and his team of developers, will be participating a on-site mentor to help facilitate the learning process.

       "  'original': '\\nQ&A with Luis Martinez, Director of Entrepreneurship at Trinity University\\nDr. Luis Martinez, Director of the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Trinity University, visited the Codeup classroom to talk to our students about entrepreneurship. Below is a Q&A from the end of his presentation.\\nHow do you differentiate between\\xa0proof of concept, prototype,\\xa0minimum viable product, and customer validation when coaching students?\\nThe first thing to ask is, “what’s the true value proposition?”. So, “what’s the ‘it’ that’s really going to be valuable?”. The second questions is, “who is the customer?”. You really need to understand your customer better than they understand him or herself. That means talking to customers, that means working with customers, that means actually going to people and saying, “look I have this idea what do you think?”. So define the true value proposition you’re trying to provide, and then match that with real customers and real customer needs.\\nThen the second step, once you make that connection and validate that value proposition with a customer match, is actually getting the “it” in front of somebody, or a version of the “it” in front of somebody to be able to sense whether or not it’s really going to be viable.\\nInvestors love you, but they love paying customers best. So between you and the investor, there’s the prototype, there’s the app that helps convince them there really is a path forward and not just some guys who’s nice to talk to but has nothing to offer.\\nHave you begun to see\\xa0more entrepreneurial models and educational approaches in high schools or middle schools across the United States?\\nThere’s a lot of stuff going on right now in high schools and middle schools, who are just beginning [entrepreneurship]. \\xa0Venture Labs, which is just down the street [from Codeup], is doing some really great work in trying to put that into the curriculum. I don’t know if it’s a fad or if it will be here permanently, but we are seeing a lot more of it. We’re also seeing a lot more young college students getting involved in entrepreneurship.\\nWhat do you think about crowdsourcing platforms as a means of defining value proposition and finding customers and funding?\\nI love crowdsourcing and crowdfunding, I think it’s a great way of determining whether your thing\\xa0is the upcoming thing\\xa0that people wanna buy. The problem with crowdsourcing is that there’s just a lot of crap out there and there’s a lot of people who are not only selling you something, but a whole bunch of stuff that you’re not gonna get. So it’s great if you’re doing it for real and using it for the right reasons.\\nFrom the inventor/startup side, it’s a phenomenal way of being able to say, “we have 5,000 people who want to buy our special sauce and so now we’ve taken that money we’re gonna go bottle that sauce.” But I urge you all to think about what the next thing is going to be. What’s after crowdsourcing? We’re already seeing a variety of that with equity crowdfunding, but is there something else that can be the next thing? When we think about the principles of crowdfunding, is there an opportunity to leapfrog and go just above that curve of innovation to be the first entrant, or occupy that first niche that does something differently?\\nIf your startup idea is an adaptation or modernization (a faster wheel, so to speak) of an earlier product, does the process of developing that idea change?\\nIt’s still the same, but it makes selling it easier. It’s like, “Facebook for cats,” like, “Sea World without large mammals,” like, “Uber, but for boats.” It’s easier to sell; there’s a higher likelihood that you know who your customer are, because there are people using it already.\\nThe challenge is that some of the big companies are already thinking about those things and they have chosen not to pursue them for various reasons. The good news for startups is that maybe the reasons corporate companies chose not to pursue are the exact reasons why you should choose to pursue them as a startup: because they’re too big, too bureaucratic to understand the real opportunity, or they chose to pass on it.\\nBe careful with an idea that’s similar to what other people are doing. Do your due diligence. Sometimes the patent literature is in the library and you can thumb through and see there was this old company that had that same idea 20 years ago, who then got bought out, and got bought, and got bought out, and no one ever did anything with it. Now if you\\xa0just tweak that idea–by taking what they did and marrying it with the cloud, marrying it with crowdsourcing, marrying it with an app platform, social media–you will then be able to see the right opportunity. If those guys are still around, it might be worth finding them and asking, “whatever happened to that?”.\\nElevator pitch versus Ted Talk?\\nYou will need different pitches for different audiences at different times, so have them all ready. You should have your 10 second elevator pitch, your 2 sentence explanation of what you do, your 3 minute pitch, your Ted Talk; you should have a deck for an investors with appendices, a deck for sales to sell your thing. There are different kinds of ways of presenting for different kinds of audiences; have all of those presentations relatively polished so when that opportunity presents itself, you can pitch it right then. Be ready.\\nStart with outlining the technically detailed way to say what you’re trying to say to other engineers, computer scientists, people who are in the field who do and see the need and will be able to make the thing that \\xa0you need to make. Then, think of the 35,000-foot big-picture version of what you’re trying to say, and sort of in between those is the rest of the world.\\n',\n",

       "  'lemmatized': 'Q&A with Luis Martinez, Director of Entrepreneurship at Trinity University Dr. Luis Martinez, Director of the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Trinity University, visited the Codeup classroom to talk to our student about entrepreneurship. Below is a Q&A from the end of his presentation. How do you differentiate between proof of concept, prototype, minimum viable product, and customer validation when coaching students? The first thing to ask is, “what’s the true value proposition?”. So, “what’s the ‘it’ that’s really going to be valuable?”. The second question is, “who is the customer?”. You really need to understand your customer better than they understand him or herself. That mean talking to customers, that mean working with customers, that mean actually going to people and saying, “look I have this idea what do you think?”. So define the true value proposition you’re trying to provide, and then match that with real customer and real customer needs. Then the second step, once you make that connection and validate that value proposition with a customer match, is actually getting the “it” in front of somebody, or a version of the “it” in front of somebody to be able to sense whether or not it’s really going to be viable. Investors love you, but they love paying customer best. So between you and the investor, there’s the prototype, there’s the app that help convince them there really is a path forward and not just some guy who’s nice to talk to but ha nothing to offer. Have you begun to see more entrepreneurial model and educational approach in high school or middle school across the United States? There’s a lot of stuff going on right now in high school and middle schools, who are just beginning [entrepreneurship]. Venture Labs, which is just down the street [from Codeup], is doing some really great work in trying to put that into the curriculum. I don’t know if it’s a fad or if it will be here permanently, but we are seeing a lot more of it. We’re also seeing a lot more young college student getting involved in entrepreneurship. What do you think about crowdsourcing platform a a mean of defining value proposition and finding customer and funding? I love crowdsourcing and crowdfunding, I think it’s a great way of determining whether your thing is the upcoming thing that people wanna buy. The problem with crowdsourcing is that there’s just a lot of crap out there and there’s a lot of people who are not only selling you something, but a whole bunch of stuff that you’re not gonna get. So it’s great if you’re doing it for real and using it for the right reasons. From the inventor/startup side, it’s a phenomenal way of being able to say, “we have 5,000 people who want to buy our special sauce and so now we’ve taken that money we’re gonna go bottle that sauce.” But I urge you all to think about what the next thing is going to be. What’s after crowdsourcing? We’re already seeing a variety of that with equity crowdfunding, but is there something else that can be the next thing? When we think about the principle of crowdfunding, is there an opportunity to leapfrog and go just above that curve of innovation to be the first entrant, or occupy that first niche that doe something differently? If your startup idea is an adaptation or modernization (a faster wheel, so to speak) of an earlier product, doe the process of developing that idea change? It’s still the same, but it make selling it easier. It’s like, “Facebook for cats,” like, “Sea World without large mammals,” like, “Uber, but for boats.” It’s easier to sell; there’s a higher likelihood that you know who your customer are, because there are people using it already. The challenge is that some of the big company are already thinking about those thing and they have chosen not to pursue them for various reasons. The good news for startup is that maybe the reason corporate company chose not to pursue are the exact reason why you should choose to pursue them a a startup: because they’re too big, too bureaucratic to understand the real opportunity, or they chose to pas on it. Be careful with an idea that’s similar to what other people are doing. Do your due diligence. Sometimes the patent literature is in the library and you can thumb through and see there wa this old company that had that same idea 20 year ago, who then got bought out, and got bought, and got bought out, and no one ever did anything with it. Now if you just tweak that idea–by taking what they did and marrying it with the cloud, marrying it with crowdsourcing, marrying it with an app platform, social media–you will then be able to see the right opportunity. If those guy are still around, it might be worth finding them and asking, “whatever happened to that?”. Elevator pitch versus Ted Talk? You will need different pitch for different audience at different times, so have them all ready. You should have your 10 second elevator pitch, your 2 sentence explanation of what you do, your 3 minute pitch, your Ted Talk; you should have a deck for an investor with appendices, a deck for sale to sell your thing. There are different kind of way of presenting for different kind of audiences; have all of those presentation relatively polished so when that opportunity present itself, you can pitch it right then. Be ready. Start with outlining the technically detailed way to say what you’re trying to say to other engineers, computer scientists, people who are in the field who do and see the need and will be able to make the thing that you need to make. Then, think of the 35,000-foot big-picture version of what you’re trying to say, and sort of in between those is the rest of the world.',\n",

       "  'original': '\\nWhat is the Value of a Codeup Education?\\nThis is a guest article\\xa0by Michael Taylor, originally posted at The Rivard Report\\xa0and Bankers Anonymous.\\n\\xa0\\nLike many, I see education from a combination of angles. Unquestionably, education makes us broader thinkers and more sparkling conversationalists. Education makes us more actualized humans.\\nBut as a finance guy, a small evil part of me always applies the $64,000 Wall Street question to every activity – from brushing my teeth to tossing a ball with a (in my case, non-existent) dog. [1] It’s the bottom-line question: “How is this making me money, like, right now?” [2]\\nOne of the problems of education, generally, is that we have a hard time proving or quantifying its value. What is the value of holding your shoulders back and head high when you walk into a job interview, knowing you’re the best they’re going to interview that week? Or the value of the feeling, when given a work assignment, of “Boom! I got this!”\\nPhilosophically, how can you put a value on just knowing more stuff?\\nCODEUP\\nThe weird thing about my friend Michael Girdley – who started the computer coding school\\xa0Codeup – is that he’s ambitious enough to say that the education community tradition of waving a hand at hard-to-measure fuzzy feelings is not good enough. Just because the education community finds it difficult to measure value doesn’t mean that business people shouldn’t try.\\nIn less than two years he’s established a pattern of tracking data on the most important finance question of education.\\xa0By that, I mean the bottom-line question: How is this making me money, like, right now?\\xa0Girdley shared with me the pre-Codeup and post-Codeup earnings of his students, along with some useful stats on entry-level and mid-career web developer salaries.\\nUsing a couple of his statistics, I want to take a stab at figuring out the total value, right now, of a student’s investment in Codeup.\\nSTATISTIC #1:\\n“The average Codeup graduate saw her annual salary jump $13,035 in the year after graduation from the program.”\\nWhat does that really mean? What can you do with that number if you plan, say, 30 working years at this higher salary?\\nIt would be great to say that a Codeup education is worth 30 times $13,035, or $391,050. However, money in the future is not as valuable to me as money today, so that calculation is not quite accurate.\\xa0I mean, you could figure it, but finance guys will give you the\\xa0time value of money\\xa0speech that you don’t want to hear again.\\nWith a salary increase of just $13,035, we can\\xa0calculate\\xa0what that amount is worth today by using a\\xa0discounted cashflow formula. So let’s be sophisticated and apply our discounted cashflow formula to 30 years of earnings, elevated by $13,035.\\nI have to assume a “discount rate,” which is some combination of taking into account inflation and future investment risks. I’m going to assume a 5% discount rate. [3] Using my 5% discount rate, I estimate the value today of my elevated salary to be $200,379.90. That’s the sum of 30 years’ worth of $13,035, but “discounted,” or translated back, into today’s dollars.\\nThat discounting allows us to more accurately compare the $16,000 tuition for Codeup with the total financial value, today, of that education.\\xa0By that measure, you pay Codeup $16K today for something worth on average, $200K,\\xa0today. [4] Another way of putting it is\\xa0that you are buying something today worth 12.5 times that amount. With these numbers, Codeup sounds like pretty good deal.\\xa0\\nSTATISTIC #2:\\n“The average web developer, nationally, earns $91,750. That’s $61,525 more than the average pre-Codeup salary of surveyed Codeup students.”\\nSo that’s interesting.\\nWe can imagine a number of reasons for this difference which don’t have to do with the value of Codeup. Maybe the average web developer is older and more experienced on the job than the average pre-Codeup student. Maybe national salaries are higher than San Antonio salaries, on average.\\nI mean, I’m sure they are.\\nBut still. If one of your goals is to swim in a higher-paid talent pool, it might pay to learn the butterfly stroke.\\nHow much would 15 peak years of earning $61,525 more than you earn now be worth, like, right now?\\xa0Again, I don’t think it’s as high as 15 times $61,525, or $922,875, because of the whole discounted cashflow of\\xa0money in the future not being worth as much money today.\\xa0Also, to be fair, you probably won’t earn the average national salary until you had a few years to ramp up your career.\\nBut what about discounting 15 years of an additional $61,525 per year, at a 5% rate, starting 5 years from now, using the exact same formula that we used before? [5] Discounting those 15 years of earning the average industry salary gives me a value, today, of $500,366.44.\\xa0Which, to state the obvious, is 31X the price of tuition.\\nWith those kinds of numbers I start to feel like that sales guy from Entourage: “What if I was to tell you that you’d pay $16,000 tuition to Codeup for something worth $500K today? Is that something you might be interested in?”\\nLook, seriously, there are a lot of assumptions embedded in my statement that “you could pay $16K in tuition today for future salary jumps worth $500K, today.”\\nMost important of these is the assumption that, by training as a programmer, you can earn the national average salary for programming jobs. And we all know there’s no guarantee that happens.\\nBut – and this is a big but [6] – it’s not a crazy assumption.\\xa0Because, really, it’s an assumption that the average happens.\\nIt’s an assumption that you could be paid what other people in your industry are generally paid. It’s an assumption that markets are somewhat efficient. \\xa0It’s an assumption that, if you have valuable skills, you can find employers and work situations just like other people.\\nAll of which makes me pretty confident that the financial return on a skills upgrade like Codeup can be somewhere between 12 and 31 times the upfront tuition cost.\\nBACK TO THE VALUE OF AN EDUCATION\\nAs I said before, education leads to more sparkling conversations as well as to a more fully actualized life. Of that, I have no doubt.\\nBut I appreciate my friend Girdley’s business-like approach to showing that the value of his program can be somewhere between a 12 and 31 times multiple of your investment.\\xa0Just thinking like a finance guy, is that something you might be interested in?\\n——–\\n[1] Notice I haven’t gotten a dog because – I ask you – where’s the profit in that?\\n[2] I’m still working on monetizing my teeth-brushing.\\n[3] How did I come up with 5%? Sorta kinda I used art in addition to science. You could call inflation 2%, so that’s a baseline for discounting the value of money in the future. Then there’s the future risk of actually earning the elevated salary, which after all is a big assumption, and also an average, and as we always say in finance ‘results may vary, past performance is no predictor of future results, etc,’ so there’s a few % points added to the inflation rate to account for that kind of risk. If you don’t like my 5% assumption, make your own, I can’t promise you I’m “right” about a 5% discount rate. You might be just as right with a different assumption. Also, remember the faux philosopher and native San Antonian Jack Handey is a good guide to these disagreements: “Instead of having ‘answers’ on a math test, they should just call them ‘impressions,’ and if you got a different ‘impression,’ so what, can’t we all be brothers?”\\n[4] In addition to the $16K tuition of course you have to do a lot of work to not only learn to code, but also, you know, earn a salary in the future. So there’s still that whole ‘work’ problem. But if you have to work, it’s nice for the finance part to at least make sense, no?\\n[5] Why did I choose 15 years and not 30 this time? Mostly because I don’t think it’s fair to assume a Codeup graduate’s salary jumps immediately to the average national salary. You work up to that. For that same reason, I calculated the value with a 5 year delay, to account for a slow ramp-up. Again, Jack Handey comes to mind: “If you ever teach a yodeling class, probably the hardest thing is to keep the students from just trying to yodel right off. You see, we build to that.”\\n[6] Hhhnn-huh. Heh. (Shut up, Beevis.)\\n\\n',\n",

In le than two year he’s established a pattern of tracking data on the most important finance question of education. By that, I mean the bottom-line question: How is this making me money, like, right now? Girdley shared with me the pre-Codeup and post-Codeup earnings of his students, along with some useful stats on entry-level and mid-career web developer salaries. Using a couple of his statistics, I want to take a stab at figuring out the total value, right now, of a student’s investment in Codeup. STATISTIC #1: “The average Codeup graduate saw her annual salary jump $13,035 in the year after graduation from the program.” What doe that really mean? What can you do with that number if you plan, say, 30 working year at this higher salary? It would be great to say that a Codeup education is worth 30 time $13,035, or $391,050. However, money in the future is not a valuable to me a money today, so that calculation is not quite accurate. I mean, you could figure it, but finance guy will give you the time value of money speech that you don’t want to hear again. With a salary increase of just $13,035, we can calculate what that amount is worth today by using a discounted cashflow formula. So let’s be sophisticated and apply our discounted cashflow formula to 30 year of earnings, elevated by $13,035. I have to assume a “discount rate,” which is some combination of taking into account inflation and future investment risks. I’m going to assume a 5% discount rate. [3] Using my 5% discount rate, I estimate the value today of my elevated salary to be $200,379.90. That’s the sum of 30 years’ worth of $13,035, but “discounted,” or translated back, into today’s dollars. That discounting allows u to more accurately compare the $16,000 tuition for Codeup with the total financial value, today, of that education. By that measure, you pay Codeup $16K today for something worth on average, $200K, today. [4] Another way of putting it is that you are buying something today worth 12.5 time that amount. With these numbers, Codeup sound like pretty good deal. STATISTIC #2: “The average web developer, nationally, earns $91,750. That’s $61,525 more than the average pre-Codeup salary of surveyed Codeup students.” So that’s interesting. We can imagine a number of reason for this difference which don’t have to do with the value of Codeup. Maybe the average web developer is older and more experienced on the job than the average pre-Codeup student. Maybe national salary are higher than San Antonio salaries, on average. I mean, I’m sure they are. But still. If one of your goal is to swim in a higher-paid talent pool, it might pay to learn the butterfly stroke. How much would 15 peak year of earning $61,525 more than you earn now be worth, like, right now? Again, I don’t think it’s a high a 15 time $61,525, or $922,875, because of the whole discounted cashflow of money in the future not being worth a much money today. Also, to be fair, you probably won’t earn the average national salary until you had a few year to ramp up your career. But what about discounting 15 year of an additional $61,525 per year, at a 5% rate, starting 5 year from now, using the exact same formula that we used before? [5] Discounting those 15 year of earning the average industry salary give me a value, today, of $500,366.44. Which, to state the obvious, is 31X the price of tuition. With those kind of number I start to feel like that sale guy from Entourage: “What if I wa to tell you that you’d pay $16,000 tuition to Codeup for something worth $500K today? Is that something you might be interested in?” Look, seriously, there are a lot of assumption embedded in my statement that “you could pay $16K in tuition today for future salary jump worth $500K, today.” Most important of these is the assumption that, by training a a programmer, you can earn the national average salary for programming jobs. And we all know there’s no guarantee that happens. But – and this is a big but [6] – it’s not a crazy assumption. Because, really, it’s an assumption that the average happens. It’s an assumption that you could be paid what other people in your industry are generally paid. It’s an assumption that market are somewhat efficient. It’s an assumption that, if you have valuable skills, you can find employer and work situation just like other people. All of which make me pretty confident that the financial return on a skill upgrade like Codeup can be somewhere between 12 and 31 time the upfront tuition cost. BACK TO THE VALUE OF AN EDUCATION As I said before, education lead to more sparkling conversation a well a to a more fully actualized life. Of that, I have no doubt. But I appreciate my friend Girdley’s business-like approach to showing that the value of his program can be somewhere between a 12 and 31 time multiple of your investment. Just thinking like a finance guy, is that something you might be interested in? ——– [1] Notice I haven’t gotten a dog because – I ask you – where’s the profit in that? [2] I’m still working on monetizing my teeth-brushing. [3] How did I come up with 5%? Sorta kinda I used art in addition to science. You could call inflation 2%, so that’s a baseline for discounting the value of money in the future. Then there’s the future risk of actually earning the elevated salary, which after all is a big assumption, and also an average, and a we always say in finance ‘results may vary, past performance is no predictor of future results, etc,’ so there’s a few % point added to the inflation rate to account for that kind of risk. If you don’t like my 5% assumption, make your own, I can’t promise you I’m “right” about a 5% discount rate. You might be just a right with a different assumption. Also, remember the faux philosopher and native San Antonian Jack Handey is a good guide to these disagreements: “Instead of having ‘answers’ on a math test, they should just call them ‘impressions,’ and if you got a different ‘impression,’ so what, can’t we all be brothers?” [4] In addition to the $16K tuition of course you have to do a lot of work to not only learn to code, but also, you know, earn a salary in the future. So there’s still that whole ‘work’ problem. But if you have to work, it’s nice for the finance part to at least make sense, no? [5] Why did I choose 15 year and not 30 this time? Mostly because I don’t think it’s fair to assume a Codeup graduate’s salary jump immediately to the average national salary. You work up to that. For that same reason, I calculated the value with a 5 year delay, to account for a slow ramp-up. Again, Jack Handey come to mind: “If you ever teach a yodeling class, probably the hardest thing is to keep the student from just trying to yodel right off. You see, we build to that.” [6] Hhhnn-huh. Heh. (Shut up, Beevis.)',\n",

This why programmers get paid so well, too.\\n1) Limited supply of people\\nEven in our very own San Antonio, TX, there just are not enough programmers to meet the demand that employers have. They often have to look elsewhere in order to find people to fulfill their technology needs. A lot of programmers who are also homegrown here in San Antonio leave the city in order to find jobs elsewhere because they are not aware of all of the opportunity that lies here. \\xa0The United States is even giving foreign people with computer science backgrounds work visas to live in the US and offer their skills. Looking for a career in which you will always be needed? This is it.\\n2) The difference between good and bad are apparent\\nAny lawyer that tells you that a case is “a slam dunk” is a bad lawyer. Any lawyer that stumbles and fumbles through the law as if he or she were riding a unicycle on a rocky road is an awful lawyer. Any programmer that builds apps full of bugs and that crash every time you open them and calls it a finished product is a bad programmer. It is easy to tell the difference between something that is good and something that is awful, especially with computer programming.
