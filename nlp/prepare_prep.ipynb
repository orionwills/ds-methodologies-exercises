       "  'original': '\\njust a few months before starting at codeup in the redwood cohort, i was sitting in the football stadium at the university of colorado at boulder, pondering what i would do after graduation. the commencement speaker that year was kate fagan, a sports reporter and commentator at espn. in her speech, something she said stuck out to me: “try replacing ‘should’ with ‘want’ and, as frequently as you are able, make decisions with that rubric. life is best when your ‘should’ and your ‘want’ are aligned.” sitting there in that stadium, i realized that i knew exactly what i should be doing after graduating, which was applying to attend graduate school for the next five years. but the actual truth was, i didn’t know what i truly wanted. did i really want to jump into something for five years that i wasn’t completely sure about? \\nwith this in mind i moved to san antonio after graduation, mostly to be closer to my family. one night at the dinner table, my brother-in-law mentioned several eye-catching billboards around town promoting a local coding bootcamp named codeup. i had dabbled a bit in coding when i was in college, so my interest was immediately piqued. however, there were doubts nagging at the back of my mind. am i even capable enough to attend an intensive coding bootcamp like this? i’m not really a super logical person… am i cut out for this? etc, etc. despite having a ton of reservations about my capabilities and the usefulness of attending a boot camp, i decided to take a leap of faith. and just a year-and-a-half later, i celebrated my one year as a software developer at armor in richardson, tx. in some ways, it feels like a dream. the hard work i put in, the days and nights of impassioned coding, pushing through all the excuses… and finally landing a dream job?! it’s a colorful blur. \\nso that’s why in this post, i want to address five common excuses that may be keeping you from considering a career in technology. at the end of the day, it doesn’t really make sense to let your fears and nagging doubts keep you from the job of your dreams.\\n1. “i’m not cut out for a career in tech”\\n\\nthis was one of the primary fears at the forefront of my mind when thinking about doing a complete shift to a technology career. and, as i went through codeup, i heard this many times from my peers. to be honest, it doesn’t ever fully go away. there are days even now at work where i think i’m in over my head and that i don’t belong there (imposter syndrome, anyone?). this fear completely disregards the fact that i’m already doing it. the truth is, it isn’t always easy. technology is constantly changing, creating new problems and forcing those within the field to continuously find new solutions. at my company, even our most senior developers are learning something new every day. we all have our doubts sometimes, but those self-limiting beliefs shouldn’t keep you from pursuing anything you set your mind to. \\n2. “i wouldn’t fit in with engineers”\\n\\nlet me ask you something. what does a veteran, electrical technician, and college music teacher have in common? well, there was at least one of each in my cohort at codeup, and all of them excelled and went on to become software developers. other characters in my cohort included a stay-at-home-mom, barista, marketing professional, and a chef. all of these, however, are just arbitrary labels. none of these people told themselves “i’m just going to be a barista forever, because that’s who i am” or “my personality only suits being in a teacher, so i’m not going to try something different.” the reality is, our self-concept is always constantly shifting. there was such a colorful diversity of backgrounds, personalities, and skill sets at codeup, proving that there’s no one type or mold of individual that can pursue a technology career. \\n3. “i don’t want to work alone all day staring at a computer screen”\\n\\nthere are days where indeed this is the case for me, just “heads down coding”, but more often than not my days are filled with collaboration and communication with my teammates. when someone runs into a problem they don’t have the knowledge to solve, they track down someone who does. when a few of us are working in the same codebase, we make sure to frequently communicate to make sure we’re not stepping on each other’s toes. on top of that, we get to be a part of producing the product, providing feedback and suggestions. there are very few days where i just sit at my desk all day, boring holes into my computer screen. although my experience may certainly be atypical, the main point i’m trying to make is that there is a large range of positions and cultures within the technology field. there are also other roles within the technology field beyond coding and data analytics, such as evangelists and solutions consultants. both of these have lots of interaction with people and clients! don’t be afraid to try a few different things until you find your fit.\\n4. “i don’t have enough experience”\\n\\nmost of us at codeup did not come in with prior experience in coding. the great thing about coding bootcamps is that they typically take you from 0 to 100 in a condensed period of time. they guide you through the entire process, allowing you to maximize your success, with everything from technical skills, networking, portfolio-building, and resume review. even with bootcamps aside, there is a plethora of both paid and free resources online that give you the ability to learn a lot of the preliminary skills you would need. there are communities (e.g. chingu) with the sole purpose of learning and building projects in new technologies. experience can be gained, so seek out those resources. they’re only a few keystrokes away. \\none thing to note about the technology field is that it’s becoming more and more heavily based on experience and not your formal education. many companies will see the value in someone who has practical experience. the reality is that many companies are shifting towards seeking out individuals that can come in and hit the ground running with practical know-how instead of purely theoretical education. \\n5. “i’m not tech savvy enough.”\\n\\nalthough basic computer skills are necessary for success, it’s probably not as much as you think. and like i mentioned above, being able to excel in this field is all about embracing change and learning to learn. you may think you’re not tech savvy because you always have issues with your radio or you can’t get your apps to work right or you get frustrated with your computer software for not doing what you want it to – all of these things are valid struggles. trust me, i’ve been there. the reality is this: many of these skills can be learned.\\n\\nas you look into pursuing a career in the technology field, don’t let these thought patterns keep you from getting where you want to be. instead, ask yourself the real questions: why do i want to do this? what kind of lifestyle do i see for myself? what am i passionate about? excuses are excuses, not truths about you and your life. set a vision and relentlessly pursue it, letting all these limiting beliefs slide off of you. they don’t have to define your journey.\\n\\n\\njoyce ling is a software developer at a cloud security company based in richardson, tx. in her free time, she sings in a women’s chorus, rock climbs, plays guitar, and currently runs an organization to bring queer women together in the dallas/ft. worth metroplex.\\xa0\\nfollow her on instagram @ironicsushi\\xa0or read more of her work at the luscious word.\\n',\n",

most likely, data scientists at google have created algorithms to take the pieces of information listed above to produce a prediction. essentially, it’s a way for a computer program to act more human. for example, think about how you recommend a show to your best friend. most likely, you know your friend’s personality and history of shows that they’ve enjoyed, so you generally know what kind of show they may like watching. \\nsimilarly, data scientists can use algorithms and statistical models to write code that continuously “learns” to make better predictions, creating an adaptable learning machine. with machine learning and artificial intelligence, google is able to generate friendly human-like recommendations for over a billion people every single month, which is probably better than what your best friend could do.\\n\\n\\nwhen robots take over the world\\nas the data science field continues to progress and we get closer and closer to true artificial intelligence, we will most likely see the effects of that trickle down into the parts of our everyday life that we hardly consider. we already trust the algorithms and generated recommendations that suggest where or when to eat. eventually, even something as vital as a life-altering surgery will be dictated by recommendations generated by algorithms for doctors. understanding and learning about data science will become more significant as it gradually becomes enmeshed with society in ways we may not even be able to fully comprehend. read more here about codeup’s 18-week data science program which covers most of the topics mentioned in this article, including data visualization, analytics, and machine learning. \\n—\\n\\njoyce ling is a software developer at a cloud security company based in richardson, tx. in her free time, she sings in a women’s chorus, rock climbs, plays guitar, and currently runs an organization to bring queer women together in the dallas/ft. worth metroplex.\\xa0\\nfollow her on instagram @ironicsushi\\xa0or read more of her work at the luscious word.\\n',\n",

       "  'lemmatized': 'You come home from work, tired to the bone and groaning a you realize you forgot to prep dinner tonight. So, what do you do? You plop down on the couch, whip out your phone and Google “restaurants near me”. You scroll down the list of place to eat and take into account a variety of factors: how high the rating are, how many people have rated that restaurant, how far it is from you, whether or not it’s busy at that moment, the keywords mentioned in reviews, how long it’s open… the list go on. You carefully bookmark each prospective restaurant so you can find it later. All of a sudden, you notice that without your knowledge, three hour have slipped by. You realize with a feeling of dread in your stomach that nearly all the restaurant around you are closed… and you head over to the nearest Whataburger in defeat. A week later, life find you in the same supine position on the couch, scrolling through restaurants. This time, though, you realize there’s a little compatibility rating next to each restaurant listing. As you scroll, you stumble upon a sushi restaurant that apparently is 90% compatible with your preferences. Without hesitation, you rush there with glee to find that it is everything you could have hoped for! Wow! Data science save the day! This very relatable experience is a prime example of how many of u have experienced data science in our life without realizing it. Let’s take a quick moment to analyze how data science played the protagonist in this story. It is important to note that data science is a broad subject that encompasses a variety of things, including first gathering and shaping data, storing that data, then analyzing and visually presenting that data. How Google Does It Before we can start analyzing data, Google data scientist must first be able to gather information about everything from restaurant locations, hours, pricing, customer reviews, etc. Next, this massive influx of data must be efficiently manipulated and organized so it can quickly be retrieved, Marie Kondo style. Data scientist are then able to take and analyze this data and visually translate it into something that make sense, such a the graph that display the busiest hour at the restaurant, or the tidy list of restaurant you see in the app that is ordered by distance from you. A simple action such a filtering by “Open Now” or “Price” requires a tight coordination of all of these step in order to actually produce the output expected by the user. Amazingly, Google Maps is able to do this analysis real-time to constantly change it result based on your current location. Not only that, it is simultaneously analyzing every single person’s GPS data real-time. This allows them to generate component like the graph of how busy an establishment is at the moment. Google Maps, A Man’s Best Friend Another important factor in data science is using analysis to drive prediction (Read more here about the difference between data analytics and data science). For example, in calculating compatibility ratings, the program take into account Google location history, search history, type of cuisine/restaurants you typically visit or avoid, whether you’ve saved/rated/visited a place or somewhere similar, or simply data that a user input about their dietary preferences. It also allows for constant feedback from the user if a compatibility rating seems off, with a “Not Right?” link attached to every rating. In other words, this rating is a prediction of how much you would like a restaurant based on your past history and behavior. So how exactly ha Google mastered this compatibility rating? Most likely, data scientist at Google have created algorithm to take the piece of information listed above to produce a prediction. Essentially, it’s a way for a computer program to act more human. For example, think about how you recommend a show to your best friend. Most likely, you know your friend’s personality and history of show that they’ve enjoyed, so you generally know what kind of show they may like watching. Similarly, data scientist can use algorithm and statistical model to write code that continuously “learns” to make better predictions, creating an adaptable learning machine. With machine learning and artificial intelligence, Google is able to generate friendly human-like recommendation for over a billion people every single month, which is probably better than what your best friend could do. When Robots Take Over the World As the data science field continues to progress and we get closer and closer to true artificial intelligence, we will most likely see the effect of that trickle down into the part of our everyday life that we hardly consider. We already trust the algorithm and generated recommendation that suggest where or when to eat. Eventually, even something a vital a a life-altering surgery will be dictated by recommendation generated by algorithm for doctors. Understanding and learning about data science will become more significant a it gradually becomes enmeshed with society in way we may not even be able to fully comprehend.

(ie. developer, q/a, tech sales, tech ed, etc)\\ns: i’ve had a few interviews this weekend and they have been very exciting and stressful. having interviews back to back is both a blessing and a curse. it’s important to destress at home and really be aware of your emotions and reactions to stress. time management is another big challenge. how much time do i put into studying versus interview prep? how much time can i dedicate to other life roles and be a good girlfriend, good daughter, and good pet owner while still fulfilling my role as a student and job seeker? these challenges are tough to overcome, and this is where emotional awareness can really help.\\nc: if you can give one piece of advice to any prospective students, what would it be? \\ns: really do your research. know what you’re getting into. you can’t go into anything blind! get as much knowledge as you can so you can thoroughly prepare for and enjoy this journey. a great plan will save you a lot of suffering in the long run.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\njoin us_ \\n\\nwe\\'re excited to launch our new codeup newsletter, which highlights some interesting blog posts, things in the know, and upcoming events. we promise to keep things interesting and engaging - twice a month. \\n\\ngeneral_ \\n\\nstudents_ \\n\\ninfo_ \\n\\nlegal_ \\n\\n \\n\\n600 navarro st. #350, san antonio, texas \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n|   info@codeup.com \\n\\n   |   210 - 802 - 7289   \\n\\n \\n\\ncomplaint policy \\n\\nprivacy center\\n\\n\\napply now \\n\\nblog \\n\\nwhy codeup \\n\\nfaq \\n\\ncontact \\n\\nour programs \\n\\nfinancials \\n\\nweb development \\n\\ndata science \\n\\nhome \\n\\nabout codeup \\n\\nemployers \\n\\nalumni \\n\\nwe promise to keep things interesting and engaging - twice a month. \\n\\ncopyright all rights reserved © 2019 codeup | website designed by tribu digital marketing \\n\\n\\n \\nvar htmldiv = document.getelementbyid(\"rs-plugin-settings-inline-css\"); var htmldivcss=\"\";\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif(htmldiv) {\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thtmldiv.innerhtml = htmldiv.innerhtml + htmldivcss;\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}else{\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tvar htmldiv = document.createelement(\"div\");\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thtmldiv.innerhtml = \"<style>\" + htmldivcss + \"</style>\";\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdocument.getelementsbytagname(\"head\")[0].appendchild(htmldiv.childnodes[0]);\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\r\\nif (setrevstartsize!==undefined) setrevstartsize(\\r\\n\\t{c: \\'#rev_slider_1_1\\', responsivelevels: [1240,1024,778,480], gridwidth: [1240,1024,778,480], gridheight: [575,500,400,720], sliderlayout: \\'fullwidth\\'});\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nvar revapi1,\\r\\n\\ttpj;\\t\\r\\n(function() {\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\tif (!/loaded|interactive|complete/.test(document.readystate)) document.addeventlistener(\"domcontentloaded\",onload); else onload();\\t\\r\\n\\tfunction onload() {\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tif (tpj===undefined) { tpj = jquery; if(\"off\" == \"on\") tpj.noconflict();}\\r\\n\\tif(tpj(\"#rev_slider_1_1\").revolution == undefined){\\n\\t\\trevslider_showdoublejqueryerror(\"#rev_slider_1_1\");\\n\\t}else{\\n\\t\\trevapi1 = tpj(\"#rev_slider_1_1\").show().revolution({\\n\\t\\t\\tslidertype:\"hero\",\\n\\t\\t\\tjsfilelocation:\"//codeup.com/wp-content/plugins/revslider/public/assets/js/\",\\n\\t\\t\\tsliderlayout:\"fullwidth\",\\n\\t\\t\\tdottedoverlay:\"none\",\\n\\t\\t\\tdelay:9000,\\n\\t\\t\\tresponsivelevels:[1240,1024,778,480],\\n\\t\\t\\tvisibilitylevels:[1240,1024,778,480],\\n\\t\\t\\tgridwidth:[1240,1024,778,480],\\n\\t\\t\\tgridheight:[575,500,400,720],\\n\\t\\t\\tlazytype:\"none\",\\n\\t\\t\\tshadow:0,\\n\\t\\t\\tspinner:\"spinner0\",\\n\\t\\t\\tautoheight:\"off\",\\n\\t\\t\\tdisableprogressbar:\"on\",\\n\\t\\t\\thidethumbsonmobile:\"off\",\\n\\t\\t\\thideslideratlimit:0,\\n\\t\\t\\thidecaptionatlimit:0,\\n\\t\\t\\thideallcaptionatlilmit:0,\\n\\t\\t\\tdebugmode:false,\\n\\t\\t\\tfallbacks: {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimplifyall:\"off\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisablefocuslistener:false,\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t});\\n\\t}; /* end of revapi call */\\n\\t\\n }; /* end of on load function */\\r\\n}()); /* end of wrapping function */\\r\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'original': '\\n\\xa0\\nwhen you’re scared to run your code, and it works the first try (halloween style)!\\n\\nwhen i first started as a developer i ran into some scary scenarios. my code was very error prone and i created some functions that i was expecting a string as the output but i got an object. it was very frustrating and i wasn’t even sure i would be able to understand software development let alone have to go and fix my code. my nightmare scenario was to be hired on as a developer and then have to troubleshoot, a.k.a. debug, some other developers code😱😱😱. i think most junior developers have had shared my fear at some point in their career. i was taught to heavily rely upon outputting your results to the console whether its good or bad to help troubleshoot.\\nin this post i will do my best to help calm the fears of my fellow junior developers with helpful debugging tools and hopefully transition away from relying upon\\xa0console.log(). while my focus will be on javascript these tools can easily be translated to other languages.\\nlogging output to the console isn’t always\\xa0helpful\\nfor the longest time\\xa0console.log()\\xa0was my go-to when i needed to debug javascript code. it was my developer friend who told me what was wrong with my code and was never judgemental\\xa0. i will admit that there are few scenarios where it is “ok” to output the results of a function to the console.\\nexcept more recently, i have found using\\xa0console.log()\\xa0to be less useful when debugging\\xa0and only making things worse by expecting a good outcome and then disappointing me. like an expired $5 amazon gift card (thanks, grandma). take for example, this gem:\\nobject doesn\\'t support property or method \\'from\\'\\nthat lovely error is from ie 11 which does not support array.from(node list) prototype without a shim/poly fill that is available\\xa0here.\\nhowever, i have come to find out that logging errors to the console is either inefficient or completely irrelevant to what may actually be causing the problem in your code. i will admit that some errors are easily resolved by reading the output of the error message and fixing the typo or following the instructions of the error message to help resolve the problem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nso in the image above we are shown a node item which has so many properties that you might not be aware of, which renders console.log useless. you have to know ahead of time what value or specific attribute you are trying to output which requires some abstract thinking or referencing documentation to identify this property. now using the console.log will output all the entire properties of the node item but its an unnecessary step to add in this line of code while you debug and then go back and remove the line of code.\\n\\n“you don’t know what you don’t know” -bill parcel (head coach new england patriots)\\n\\nthe error the console outputs might provide you with the location of the error, but you may not know why are you getting the error in the first place. maybe you’re passing the incorrect value to the function or you are working with event handling and\\xa0bubbling events.\\neither way, chances are that you aren’t thinking about that one property that is actually passing the value your expecting because you weren’t aware of how to call it or pass it along.\\ni’m going to piggy back off of\\xa0mozilla’s debug playground\\xa0as an example for why you shouldn’t use the console and instead use the browsers built-in debugger or equally as helpful is an ide’s built-in debugger.\\ncough cough\\xa0visual studio code\\xa0cough cough\\n\\xa0now, whether you prefer chrome over firefox is a whole different can-o-worms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nide tools and online\\xa0repls\\n\\n“hey man, i’m a back-end developer and so i need to console.log”\\n-fictional backend developer\\n\\nso maybe you don’t have a fully fleshed out web form or you’re trying to get data from some api or json file. you need to see data from the function you’re writing or better yet you want to test a function that someone else wrote without having to clone the entire project. using\\xa0console.log()\\xa0seems like the go to. in fact,\\xa0around ¾ of node.js developers report using it\\xa0(in 2017) for finding errors in their applications.\\ni’m here to tell you of a few better ways to debug your code.\\nide tools\\nthe first tool i have come to love and trust is one made by a company called\\xa0wallaby.js\\nquokkajs (integrated scratchpad for javascript)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwith this plug-in you can write your code and get immediate results. no need to throw in a bunch of console.log’s in your function and check the output. it has an integration for\\xa0vscode\\xa0(💖💖💖 ),\\xa0jetbrainside\\xa0and\\xa0atom. i personally have purchased a pro license but for the most part the community version will work just fine.\\nsonarlint\\xa0( like spellcheck but for your code)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ni think all developers should have some sort of code linting tool added into their ide. this helps review your code in real-time and “should” prevent you from compiling or running code with errors in it. i’ve chosen sonarlint because its given me better results than es6 linter or some other linting tools that i’ve tried. i’m not saying its the best or that the others don’t work but i haven’t had to configure much other than just installing the extension.\\nscratchpad (built-in browser javascript sandbox)\\nmozilla also offers a feature in their\\xa0devtools\\xa0that allows you to write, run, and view the output of javascript code that can interact with the current web page or not.\\nrepls\\ni have a background in\\xa0.net development and i have fallen in love with\\xa0microsoft’s f# language\\xa0along with the\\xa0fsharp community. while going through the documentation i was introduced to a new term, repl.\\nrepl stands for:\\xa0read-evaluate-print-loop.\\n“ in a repl, the user enters one or more expressions (rather than an entire\\xa0compilation unit) and the repl evaluates them and displays the results.” -wikipedia\\nso i thought, this was cool and i used my googliness™️ to search for an online version or service and so i came upon this.\\n\\nrepl.it\\n\\ni don’t need to console.log my output or assign the function to\\xa0var result = greeting()\\xa0and then\\xa0console.log(greeting(\"jessica\"))\\xa0. i just write my function, invoke it and boom! i get the output without the need of\\xa0console.log()\\xa0.\\n\\nrepl.it supports many languages!\\n\\n\\ni can even create a repl, write some code and share the link with someone that can give me feedback, brilliant!\\ncoincidentally, repl.it uses\\xa0monaco, which is the same editor that vscode uses.\\nfinally, for the developer on a budget (including myself) most popular ides have a built-in debugger that works the same was as the debugger in chrome or firefox.\\ni’ve kindly added links to how-tos: for a few ides (don’t get mad if your ide is not listed, i’m looking at you atom ide community).\\ndebugging in vscode\\xa0\\ndebugging in jetbrains intellij\\ndebugging in visual studio\\nfinal thoughts\\nso why have i gone through the long winded trouble of explaining / trying to convince you why you should wean yourself off of using the console.log and embrace debugging tools? how was this suppose to make you feel better / more confident in writing code?\\nthe short answer is:\\xa0i believe having more information and proper tools “should” make coding, and for that matter debugging, less daunting / scary.\\nuse of widely available, open-source debugging tools is key to be more familiar with software development and to grow as a developer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\njoin us_ \\n\\nwe\\'re excited to launch our new codeup

I think most junior developer have had shared my fear at some point in their career. I wa taught to heavily rely upon outputting your result to the console whether it good or bad to help troubleshoot. In this post I will do my best to help calm the fear of my fellow junior developer with helpful debugging tool and hopefully transition away from relying upon console.log(). While my focus will be on JavaScript these tool can easily be translated to other languages. Logging output to the console isn’t always helpful For the longest time console.log() wa my go-to when I needed to debug JavaScript code. It wa my developer friend who told me what wa wrong with my code and wa never judgemental . I will admit that there are few scenario where it is “OK” to output the result of a function to the console. Except more recently, I have found using console.log() to be le useful when debugging and only making thing worse by expecting a good outcome and then disappointing me. Like an expired $5 Amazon Gift Card (Thanks, grandma). Take for example, this gem: Object doesn\\'t support property or method \\'from\\' That lovely error is from IE 11 which doe not support Array.from(node List) prototype without a shim/poly fill that is available here. However, I have come to find out that logging error to the console is either inefficient or completely irrelevant to what may actually be causing the problem in your code. I will admit that some error are easily resolved by reading the output of the error message and fixing the typo or following the instruction of the error message to help resolve the problem. So in the image above we are shown a node item which ha so many property that you might not be aware of, which render console.log useless. You have to know ahead of time what value or specific attribute you are trying to output which requires some abstract thinking or referencing documentation to identify this property. Now using the console.log will output all the entire property of the node item but it an unnecessary step to add in this line of code while you debug and then go back and remove the line of code. “You don’t know what you don’t know” -Bill Parcel (Head Coach New England Patriots) The error the console output might provide you with the location of the error, but you may not know why are you getting the error in the first place. Maybe you’re passing the incorrect value to the function or you are working with event handling and bubbling events. Either way, chance are that you aren’t thinking about that one property that is actually passing the value your expecting because you weren’t aware of how to call it or pas it along. I’m going to piggy back off of Mozilla’s Debug Playground a an example for why you shouldn’t use the console and instead use the Browsers built-in debugger or equally a helpful is an IDE’s built-in debugger. cough cough Visual Studio Code cough cough Now, whether you prefer Chrome over FireFox is a whole different can-o-worms. IDE Tools and Online REPLs “Hey man, I’m a back-end developer and so I need to console.log” -Fictional Backend Developer So maybe you don’t have a fully fleshed out web form or you’re trying to get data from some API or JSON file. You need to see data from the function you’re writing or better yet you want to test a function that someone else wrote without having to clone the entire project. Using console.log() seems like the go to. In fact, around ¾ of Node.js developer report using it (in 2017) for finding error in their applications. I’m here to tell you of a few better way to debug your code. IDE Tools The first tool I have come to love and trust is one made by a company called Wallaby.js QuokkaJS (Integrated Scratchpad for JavaScript) With this plug-in you can write your code and get immediate results. No need to throw in a bunch of console.log’s in your function and check the output. It ha an integration for VSCode (💖💖💖 ), JetBrainsIDE and Atom. I personally have purchased a pro license but for the most part the community version will work just fine. SonarLint ( Like spellcheck but for your code) I think all developer should have some sort of code linting tool added into their IDE. This help review your code in real-time and “should” prevent you from compiling or running code with error in it. I’ve chosen SonarLint because it given me better result than ES6 linter or some other linting tool that i’ve tried. I’m not saying it the best or that the others don’t work but I haven’t had to configure much other than just installing the extension. Scratchpad (Built-in Browser Javascript sandbox) Mozilla also offer a feature in their DevTools that allows you to write, run, and view the output of JavaScript code that can interact with the current web page or not. REPLs I have a background in .NET development and I have fallen in love with Microsoft’s F# Language along with the fsharp community. While going through the documentation I wa introduced to a new term, REPL. REPL stand for: Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop. “ In a REPL, the user enters one or more expression (rather than an entire compilation unit) and the REPL evaluates them and display the results.” -Wikipedia So I thought, this wa cool and I used my Googliness™️ to search for an online version or service and so I came upon THIS. REPL.IT I don’t need to console.log my output or assign the function to var result = greeting() and then console.log(greeting(\"Jessica\")) . I just write my function, invoke it and BOOM! I get the output without the need of console.log() . Repl.it support many languages! I can even create a Repl, write some code and share the link with someone that can give me feedback, Brilliant! Coincidentally, Repl.it us Monaco, which is the same Editor that VSCode uses. Finally, for the developer on a budget (including myself) most popular IDEs have a built-in debugger that work the same wa a the debugger in Chrome or Firefox. I’ve kindly added link to How-Tos: For a few IDEs (don’t get mad if your IDE is not listed, I’m looking at you Atom IDE community). Debugging in VSCode Debugging in JetBrains IntelliJ Debugging in Visual Studio Final Thoughts So why have I gone through the long winded trouble of explaining / trying to convince you why you should wean yourself off of using the console.log and embrace debugging tools? How wa this suppose to make you feel better / more confident in writing code? The short answer is: I believe having more information and proper tool “should” make coding, and for that matter debugging, le daunting / scary. Use of widely available, open-source debugging tool is key to be more familiar with software development and to grow a a developer.

       "  'category': '\\xa0in uncategorized',\n",
       "  'original': '\\ni remember during my first day of codeup i began to doubt my ability to overcome the challenges that lay ahead.\\xa0i soon learned that what i was experiencing was “impostor syndrome.” jason straughan, codeup’s ceo, introduced us to this phenomenon that same day. thanks to his kind advice i was able to identify, and overcome my doubts.\\xa0codeup shared many valuable lessons with me, but some lessons were taught through exposure outside of the vogue building. if you decide to enroll at codeup, you will find yourself learning many things outside the classroom.\\xa0i realized through my own journey that there are things codeup didn’t tell me. so, i’ve narrowed it down to the 5 main things i had to learn on my own as a newly placed software developer.\\nyou need to be multilingual\\n\\nyou need to be adaptable and willing to open your ears to all ideas. they say the best way to learn a different language is through practice. in most of our professional and non-professional lives, relationships will have an assigned lingo to properly cater to that relationship. furthermore, professional groups and organizations like projectquest, h-e-b, and codeup have their own kind of language. these languages are used to identify and recognize individuals of that group or organization. it is important to keep this in mind before you start any application process, or start working with new people.\\neven though i did not have a college degree, i still had an interest in developing coding skills. i understood early on in my application process that i was in control of my outcome. i assumed determination contained the key to my success, and soon found myself being referred to projectquest for financial assistance.i would have never known about projectquest if the codeup staff had not offered this vital information. the dedication and support offered by these organizations helped me through the multiple application processes. if you plan to visit projectquest or workforce solutions to inquire about their grants, make sure you’re determined to learn their language, and earn the money. if you have the right amount of determination you can find the proper channels fueling san antonio’s stem ecosystem through a simple google search. determination is one of the common denominators all codeup graduates share, and if you too share this similarity, check out the\\xa0scholarships\\xa0offered by codeup.\\npeople want jobs, but not everyone wants to work.\\n\\nvia giphy\\ncodeup’s mission statement is the following, “at codeup, we focus on two things: you and your success. find a job within six months of graduation,\\xa0or get 50% of your tuition returned.” let me assure you they deliver in service, \\xa0content, and in career guidance. however, the staff cannot force you to either study the curriculum or develop programming skills for you. there are people that come ready to overcome adversity, then there are the few who expect to be fed morning tacos with a silver spoon. if you’re seriously considering codeup, you need to prepare yourself to manage the beautiful chaos of assignments, interviews, and presentations.\\nmy high school soccer coach had a saying, “do you think ronaldo is going to parachute from a helicopter and score for you?” we never expected ronaldo at our high school practices but that was our coach handing down some of his kind wisdom. he used this as a tactic to build the team up before the start of our shooting drills. ronaldo is a world star player who plays at a professional level so what coach ramos was really trying to say was, “work hard if you want the goal. don’t expect someone to come and score for you!” you need to have a sense of responsibility before embarking on your own journey and launching your career.\\nhave a servant’s heart.\\nsome lessons weren’t coming from a screen or projector and i considered these some of my favorite lessons because they spoke more about human character. a perfect example is when the codeup staff noticed a need in our community and decided to share their passion for service with all san antonians. the office staff\\xa0volunteered to serve\\xa0at the san antonio food bank. this was one of the unspoken teachings codeup shared with me – these amazing individuals create an environment where you can grow in skill and as a human being. kudos to them!\\ni will iterate once again that codeup will not force you to do something you don’t want to do. as a newly placed member of this ecosystem and a codeup graduate i would like to ask codeup fellows and members of the community to ponder, “how are we contributing to the san antonio ecosystem?” having the heart of a servant is something codeup can’t force you to do, but is a skill necessary to achieve self growth and development.\\ndon’t eat the tacos!\\n\\nvia giphy\\ncodeup is geared to focus on your professional life, and not your waistline. the codeup family loves to spoil the cohorts with food, they must know the way to a developer’s heart. the morning tacos, the pizza, and snacks should be enough to lure you into the vogue building. i loved every bite and sip of these delicious perks. however i do have to confess i gained a few pounds during my time at codeup. i was also on a budget so the ramen noodle isle at the walgreens became very familiar. now that i look back i wish i only had one slice of pizza instead of my usual three.\\none of the hardest parts of my codeup journey was finding time to exercise. taking care of myself felt impossible in this intense immersive environment, but believe me when i say “it is possible!” this was thanks to one of my colleagues, who insisted on completing daily reps of stairs up and down the travis park garage.i felt instant restoration after just a few days of exercise. this simple exercise routine helped me deal with stress and gave me enough time to meditate on the things that pushed me towards triumph.\\ndon’t bite the hand that feeds you.\\nthe saying “don’t bite the hand that feeds you” has stuck with me since i was thirteen years old, and made the dumb decision to complain about my job in front of my dad. my dad was not fond of me complaining of the man who signed my checks, so he shared a lesson behind his belligerent words. this made me realize that my ego was blocking my ability to humble myself, and that i needed to be thankful to the people that were trying to help me. his wise words taught me to stay loyal to those who become part of my upbringing.\\nthis saying has stuck with me ever since, and i decided to mark it as a special lesson. a lesson i could only acquired through experience. i realize now the same goes with any organization or relationship that we hold, professional or non professional. we should be able to acknowledge where our loyalties stand, and if we are giving the proper amount of recognition to those who have helped us.\\nthe codeup staff did everything in their power to plug me into a bigger network of opportunities. lastly, i was exposed to a network of genuinely loving, and caring people. these amazing benefits make me appreciate the\\xa0codeup program\\xa0so much more. i walked in with the desire to learn computer programming. i am leaving with the ability and skills that say “i am a software developer!”\\n',\n",

If you’r serious consid codeup, you need to prepar yourself to manag the beauti chao of assignments, interviews, and presentations.

       "  'lemmatized': 'I remember during my first day of Codeup I began to doubt my ability to overcome the challenge that lay ahead. I soon learned that what I wa experiencing wa “impostor syndrome.” Jason Straughan, Codeup’s CEO, introduced u to this phenomenon that same day. Thanks to his kind advice I wa able to identify, and overcome my doubts. Codeup shared many valuable lesson with me, but some lesson were taught through exposure outside of the Vogue building. If you decide to enroll at Codeup, you will find yourself learning many thing outside the classroom. I realized through my own journey that there are thing Codeup didn’t tell me. So, I’ve narrowed it down to the 5 main thing I had to learn on my own a a newly placed software developer. You Need to be Multilingual You need to be adaptable and willing to open your ear to all ideas. They say the best way to learn a different language is through practice. In most of our professional and non-professional lives, relationship will have an assigned lingo to properly cater to that relationship. Furthermore, professional group and organization like projectQUEST, H-E-B, and Codeup have their own kind of language. These language are used to identify and recognize individual of that group or organization. It is important to keep this in mind before you start ANY application process, or start working with new people. Even though I did not have a college degree, I still had an interest in developing coding skills. I understood early on in my application process that I wa in control of my outcome. I assumed determination contained the key to my success, and soon found myself being referred to ProjectQUEST for financial assistance.I would have never known about ProjectQUEST if the Codeup staff had not offered this vital information. The dedication and support offered by these organization helped me through the multiple application processes. If you plan to visit projectQUEST or Workforce Solutions to inquire about their grants, make sure you’re determined to learn their language, and earn the money. If you have the right amount of determination you can find the proper channel fueling San Antonio’s STEM ecosystem through a simple Google search. Determination is one of the common denominator all Codeup graduate share, and if you too share this similarity, check out the scholarship offered by Codeup. People want jobs, but not everyone want to work. via GIPHY Codeup’s mission statement is the following, “At Codeup, we focus on two things: you and your success. Find a job within six month of graduation, or get 50% of your tuition returned.” Let me assure you they deliver in service, content, and in career guidance. However, the staff cannot force you to either study the curriculum or develop programming skill for you. There are people that come ready to overcome adversity, then there are the few who expect to be fed morning taco with a silver spoon. If you’re seriously considering Codeup, you need to prepare yourself to manage the beautiful chaos of assignments, interviews, and presentations. My high school soccer coach had a saying, “Do you think Ronaldo is going to parachute from a helicopter and score for you?” We never expected Ronaldo at our high school practice but that wa our coach handing down some of his kind wisdom. He used this a a tactic to build the team up before the start of our shooting drills. Ronaldo is a world star player who play at a professional level so what coach Ramos wa really trying to say was, “Work hard if you want the goal. Don’t expect someone to come and score for you!” You need to have a sense of responsibility before embarking on your own journey and launching your career. Have a servant’s heart. Some lesson weren’t coming from a screen or projector and I considered these some of my favorite lesson because they spoke more about human character. A perfect example is when the Codeup staff noticed a need in our community and decided to share their passion for service with all San Antonians. The office staff volunteered to serve at the San Antonio Food Bank. This wa one of the unspoken teaching Codeup shared with me – these amazing individual create an environment where you can grow in skill and a a human being. Kudos to them! I will iterate once again that Codeup will not force you to do something you don’t want to do. As a newly placed member of this ecosystem and a Codeup graduate I would like to ask Codeup fellow and member of the community to ponder, “How are we contributing to the San Antonio ecosystem?” Having the heart of a servant is something Codeup can’t force you to do, but is a skill necessary to achieve self growth and development. Don’t eat the tacos! via GIPHY Codeup is geared to focus on your professional life, and not your waistline. The Codeup family love to spoil the cohort with food, they must know the way to a developer’s heart. The morning tacos, the pizza, and snack should be enough to lure you into the Vogue building. I loved every bite and sip of these delicious perks. However I do have to confess I gained a few pound during my time at Codeup. I wa also on a budget so the ramen noodle isle at the Walgreens became very familiar. Now that I look back I wish I only had one slice of pizza instead of my usual three. One of the hardest part of my Codeup journey wa finding time to exercise. Taking care of myself felt impossible in this intense immersive environment, but believe me when I say “It is possible!” This wa thanks to one of my colleagues, who insisted on completing daily rep of stair up and down the Travis Park garage.I felt instant restoration after just a few day of exercise. This simple exercise routine helped me deal with stress and gave me enough time to meditate on the thing that pushed me towards triumph. Don’t bite the hand that feed you. The saying “Don’t bite the hand that feed you” ha stuck with me since I wa thirteen year old, and made the dumb decision to complain about my job in front of my dad. My dad wa not fond of me complaining of the man who signed my checks, so he shared a lesson behind his belligerent words. This made me realize that my ego wa blocking my ability to humble myself, and that I needed to be thankful to the people that were trying to help me. His wise word taught me to stay loyal to those who become part of my upbringing. This saying ha stuck with me ever since, and I decided to mark it a a special lesson. A lesson I could only acquired through experience. I realize now the same go with any organization or relationship that we hold, professional or non professional. We should be able to acknowledge where our loyalty stand, and if we are giving the proper amount of recognition to those who have helped us. The Codeup staff did everything in their power to plug me into a bigger network of opportunities. Lastly, I wa exposed to a network of genuinely loving, and caring people. These amazing benefit make me appreciate the Codeup program so much more. I walked in with the desire to learn computer programming. I am leaving with the ability and skill that say “I am a software developer!”',\n",

Here is my first person to thank: a male friend of mine who ha been a programmer for years, who strongly encouraged me that this wa a great direction for me to take to secure fulfillment and my continued independence. I struggled to find statistic on this, but I have heard many similar story from woman about the men in their life (friends, family, boyfriends, husbands) who work in the tech industry and encouraged them to learn to code. On the first day of class, I counted: 6 woman out of 23 total students. Not bad! Despite the fact that these woman were of different ages, marital statuses, careers, and stage of life, we all quickly bonded. Within the first few weeks, we even planned our own Girls Night Out at a bar across the street from campus (that the guy from our cohort crashed, and I don’t think anyone wa upset about that)! We also all participated in Codeup’s weekly women’s lunches, with featured female speaker who were alumna or from the tech industry. Throughout the entire 18 strenuous weeks, these woman and I supported and checked in with each other. Luckily, everyone in our cohort did the same, no matter the gender. Thank you for this, Redwood woman and men! To make a long story short, I wa hired a a full stack developer a month before my graduation, with a decent pay bump from my previous career, and am now working in my second job in the field (yet another pay bump!) where I feel personally valued on a daily basis. All of this, le than a year since starting Codeup! As my final thank you, I am extremely grateful to Codeup for awarding me their Women in Tech scholarship, because it significantly reduced the loan amount I needed to attend, helped relieve a little bit of the anxiety of paying for Codeup, gave me more incentive to attend, and confirmed that I indeed wa exactly what Codeup and employer were looking for in student and coders. If you’re a woman who desire independence and self-fulfillment, Codeup is worth it! Make sure to apply to the scholarship during your admission process and feel free to reach out to me or other female alumna if you want to hear more about our experience before, during, and after Codeup. — Amy is very proud to say she is currently the only female developer employee working on Whataburger’s first ever online ordering platform. She ha a Master’s degree in Music Theory and keep that knowledge fresh by analyzing music on the radio during her daily commute. Since learning to code, what she enjoys the most is mentoring new developers.',\n",

       "  'original': '\\n5 hiring trends in software development\\n\\xa0\\ncompanies (and ideal candidates) care about solving problems for the end user.\\nhiring needs in the tech industry – specifically on software development teams – evolve almost as quickly as the technologies themselves. one year employers are trying to get their hands on ruby developers, and 12 months later, a new javascript framework is all the buzz. this doesn’t make things easy for job seekers or new employers looking to hire their first software developers.\\ndrawing on conversations with our 200+ employer partners at codeup, we’ve compiled a shortlist of five trends we’ve seen emerge recently. in a nutshell, it’s all about solving problems for the end user.\\nthe growing popularity of agile has created more opportunities for full-stack developers.\\nfirst, what is agile? in a nutshell, it’s a set of management practices that allows software developers to write code and build products more efficiently.\\nagile has gained serious ground in it departments across a variety of industries, from finance to food service. while agile doesn’t explicitly require a team of full-stack developers, it does ask developers to be fully engaged in all facets of building an application, from creating user stories to deployment. as a result, roles on an agile team start to blur, and each individual winds up working on features across the tech stack.=\\nthere’s no doubt that a team of specialized front-end and back-end developers can build great software. however, today’s hiring managers seem to have a preference for full-stack developers, or at least those who understand both sides of a given tech stack, because these well-rounded employees have a leg up on others in an agile environment.\\ngood software development leverages design thinking across the stack to benefit the end user.\\nstructure and efficiency are still important for software engineers to get right, but more and more, it’s critical for developers to code across the stack with the end user at top of mind. in fact, agile teams dedicate time to create user stories that inform the products they build, and each team member is involved in a recurring (or iterative) design process.\\ntim brown, the ceo of international design firm ideo, says, “design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.”\\nsoftware is everywhere these days, and it’s not just for techies. solutions need to be slick, innovative, and easy-to-use. the latest version of ios or android needs to be impressive enough for tech enthusiasts to get excited about and straightforward enough for grandpa to check his voicemail. most importantly, good developers realize those two things aren’t mutually exclusive.\\njavascript takes candidates further than ever before.\\nnow more than ever, a strong understanding of javascript can really help software developers land a great job.\\nonce a fairly basic, client-side scripting language, javascript has made powerful gains in functionality while staying lean and efficient. in recent years, node.js, a server-side runtime, has transformed javascript into a full-stack powerhouse.\\njavascript continues to deliver on the front-end, too: react.js has revolutionized user interface development and has become the front-end javascript framework of choice for fortune 500 companies and startups alike.\\ndiverse and non-traditional candidates are in the spotlight.\\ndiversity in tech remains elusive and persists as a key talking point in the industry. women, as well as black, latinx, and lgbt workers, remain severely underrepresented. in light of this year’s high-profile headlines on gender diversity issues at uber and google, many tech companies have doubled down on their commitments to boost workplace equality and employ people who authentically empathize with a diverse group of end users.\\nwe’ve also noticed a growing trend toward diversity initiatives that aim to include nontraditional hires like military veterans, career changers, and candidates without four-year degrees. for example, the microsoft leap initiative seeks candidates who have tech experience but may have been out of work for a while (e.g., stay-at-home moms or dads) or career changers with at least six months of software development experience.\\nstrong problem-solving skills remain the common denominator among great developers, and interviewers know it.\\nthis is less of a hiring trend than it is a skill that employers continue to require of all new developers, especially non-traditional hires who may not have a computer science degree or years of experience.\\nsoftware developers – especially those new to the field – are in a constant state of learning new technologies and solving problems they’ve never encountered before. the ability to define a problem, recognize key inputs, and identify potential solutions is particularly important when the quality of a line of code depends on the developer’s ability to think logically and efficiently.\\ninterviewers often ask candidates to walk through a scenario, usually a past experience or a hypothetical case study, where the candidate needs to demonstrate their ability to assess a problem and formulate a solution. sometimes these questions can be technical and quantitative, other times they’re more behavioral, but either way, it’s clear that companies want employees who think well on their feet and come to their managers with solutions instead of self-explanatory questions.\\nconclusion: honing your skills to meet employment trends can help you get a software development job, but first, invest in learning the fundamentals of programming.\\nbeyond these trends, employers continue to look for one thing above all else: technical skills! before learning a new javascript framework and doing research on best practices for design thinking, you’ve got to have the fundamentals of software development under your belt. that’s where codeup comes in. our 18-week career accelerator gives you all the tools and training you need to capitalize on these trends and land a great job as a software developer.\\nto learn

       "  'lemmatized': '5 Hiring Trends in Software Development Companies (and ideal candidates) care about solving problem for the end user. Hiring need in the tech industry – specifically on software development team – evolve almost a quickly a the technology themselves. One year employer are trying to get their hand on Ruby developers, and 12 month later, a new JavaScript framework is all the buzz. This doesn’t make thing easy for job seeker or new employer looking to hire their first software developers. Drawing on conversation with our 200+ employer partner at Codeup, we’ve compiled a shortlist of five trend we’ve seen emerge recently. In a nutshell, it’s all about solving problem for the end user. The growing popularity of Agile ha created more opportunity for full-stack developers. First, what is Agile? In a nutshell, it’s a set of management practice that allows software developer to write code and build product more efficiently. Agile ha gained serious ground in IT department across a variety of industries, from finance to food service. While Agile doesn’t explicitly require a team of full-stack developers, it doe ask developer to be fully engaged in all facet of building an application, from creating user story to deployment. As a result, role on an Agile team start to blur, and each individual wind up working on feature across the tech stack.= There’s no doubt that a team of specialized front-end and back-end developer can build great software. However, today’s hiring manager seem to have a preference for full-stack developers, or at least those who understand both side of a given tech stack, because these well-rounded employee have a leg up on others in an Agile environment. Good software development leverage design thinking across the stack to benefit the end user. Structure and efficiency are still important for software engineer to get right, but more and more, it’s critical for developer to code across the stack with the end user at top of mind. In fact, Agile team dedicate time to create user story that inform the product they build, and each team member is involved in a recurring (or iterative) design process. Tim Brown, the CEO of international design firm IDEO, says, “Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draw from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the need of people, the possibility of technology, and the requirement for business success.” Software is everywhere these days, and it’s not just for techies. Solutions need to be slick, innovative, and easy-to-use. The latest version of iOS or Android need to be impressive enough for tech enthusiast to get excited about and straightforward enough for grandpa to check his voicemail. Most importantly, good developer realize those two thing aren’t mutually exclusive. JavaScript take candidate further than ever before. Now more than ever, a strong understanding of JavaScript can really help software developer land a great job. Once a fairly basic, client-side scripting language, JavaScript ha made powerful gain in functionality while staying lean and efficient. In recent years, Node.js, a server-side runtime, ha transformed JavaScript into a full-stack powerhouse. JavaScript continues to deliver on the front-end, too: React.js ha revolutionized user interface development and ha become the front-end JavaScript framework of choice for Fortune 500 company and startup alike. Diverse and non-traditional candidate are in the spotlight. Diversity in tech remains elusive and persists a a key talking point in the industry. Women, a well a black, Latinx, and LGBT workers, remain severely underrepresented. In light of this year’s high-profile headline on gender diversity issue at Uber and Google, many tech company have doubled down on their commitment to boost workplace equality and employ people who authentically empathize with a diverse group of end users. We’ve also noticed a growing trend toward diversity initiative that aim to include nontraditional hire like military veterans, career changers, and candidate without four-year degrees. For example, the Microsoft LEAP initiative seek candidate who have tech experience but may have been out of work for a while (e.g., stay-at-home mom or dads) or career changer with at least six month of software development experience. Strong problem-solving skill remain the common denominator among great developers, and interviewer know it. This is le of a hiring trend than it is a skill that employer continue to require of all new developers, especially non-traditional hire who may not have a computer science degree or year of experience. Software developer – especially those new to the field – are in a constant state of learning new technology and solving problem they’ve never encountered before. The ability to define a problem, recognize key inputs, and identify potential solution is particularly important when the quality of a line of code depends on the developer’s ability to think logically and efficiently. Interviewers often ask candidate to walk through a scenario, usually a past experience or a hypothetical case study, where the candidate need to demonstrate their ability to ass a problem and formulate a solution. Sometimes these question can be technical and quantitative, other time they’re more behavioral, but either way, it’s clear that company want employee who think well on their foot and come to their manager with solution instead of self-explanatory questions. Conclusion: Honing your skill to meet employment trend can help you get a software development job, but first, invest in learning the fundamental of programming. Beyond these trends, employer continue to look for one thing above all else: technical skills! Before learning a new JavaScript framework and doing research on best practice for design thinking, you’ve got to have the fundamental of software development under your belt. That’s where Codeup come in. Our 18-week career accelerator give you all the tool and training you need to capitalize on these trend and land a great job a a software developer.

       "  'original': '\\nalumni spotlight: stefanie young and lorne barfield\\n\\xa0\\nstefanie young and lorne barfield are both codeup grads and the co-founders of innov8 place, a website development company. here, they share their highs, their lows, their experience and their best tips for succeeding during and after the program.\\nplease give a little introduction about yourself.\\nstefanie: i’m originally from california. i grew up in the silicon valley before the days of google and had a pretty decent handle on free internet via aol trial discs, napster torrenting, and multi-player gaming platforms (before they were cool). given the mid to late 90’s, i had quite a bit of backlash within the online communities for my gender and my age. i gave up on tech during my early college years when a female professor told me, “there no room for women in the booming tech industry.” i quickly turned to music and language arts and found myself pursuing the long-term degree before leaving for texas to enter a japanese studies program. i had a rude awakening and poor experience when most jobs i was offered were non-technical, non-creative, and extremely repetitive. it wasn’t going to work. my grandfather had always been a firm believer that i was meant for tech, engineering and developing new ideas. after chatting with him about my failed attempts and unhappiness, i decided to give tech another try through coding and entered into the codeup family. i worked full-time while attending a night class and found myself doubting my abilities from the beginning. during our first project, something clicked and with the help of the instructors, i had a new-found love for problem solving, developing and code. i haven’t turned back since.\\nlorne:\\xa0i’m also from california. \\xa0i hail from oakland. \\xa0i’m into just about everything. \\xa0i have worked as a high school basketball coach, personal chef, bartender, bouncer, opera singer, paralegal/legal assistant, and dance instructor. \\xa0i love movies and books….i read about 40+ a year. \\xa0i’m into fantasy and sci-fi, but also enjoy reading deepak chopra and books about travelogues (which is somewhat funny because i’m terrified of traveling). i’m a hippie, jock, musician, and nerd. i love people and connection and for someone who grew up largely an only child, i’m always out creating new family. \\xa0if something interests me, i pursue it. \\xa0i like to dive into things that i can share with others. \\xa0i’m an avid nba fan (go warriors!) and if you ever want to argue about basketball, i’m game. \\xa0if you want to see me fully free and in my element, put me around music and dancing. programming puts me back in my lego days, where i get to be creative and build things. it’s my new adventure. \\n\\ncan you describe your career path and how you got to where you are now? were you always interested in programming?\\nstefanie: i wasn’t always interested in programming. i had always seen programming as a career that leads to a dark room with smelly individuals, cheetos and mountain dew. i didn’t want to be placed in a cubical and made to work 10 – 16 hour days to complete a project or operating system. web development when i first set out to learn tech was not a major degree option or talked about much. browsers were faulty and new to the scene. it was a questionable career path at the time. my grandfather was an engineer with stanford university and always brought home hardware for pcs. i thought that would be my path as well. i loved building and problem solving the communication errors between parts. little did i know that programming was that too on a more abstract and dynamic level.\\nlorne: i absolutely thought programming was way out of my range and my experience. \\xa0nothing about it felt like something i would be into. \\xa0i had simply grown out of my old position and location. \\xa0i was a paralegal in san francisco and i was no longer challenged. \\xa0i wanted to go back to school or do something new but had no clue what. \\xa0it was too expensive to do there, my parents brought up codeup (they live here), and here i am. \\n\\nwhy did you look into an immersive program? why the codeup experience?\\nstefanie:\\xa0honestly, i was extremely doubtful of the program, especially after being trained into the thought process that traditional college was the only form of useful education and the only experience one should seek before career searching. it wasn’t until i was trying to break into marketing firms, coding communities and design groups that i was told about the program. three people approached me and recommended the program. i didn’t listen. then life started shouting it at me. i saw the billboard… then a marketing card in the mail… and then i heard a friend talking about their acceptance into the program. finally i gave in and went to the codeup location.i took a couple of tests and passed with flying colors. i decided to take the leap since they were offering a night program that started after work hours. since they helped with job placement as well, i took them to be my chance at a better work life.\\nlorne: i was on the verge of going to teach english in turkey when my parents suggested that i look at codeup. \\xa0i took the test, not sure if i’d get in, and then when i did, i bought a ticket the next day and the rest is history. \\nwhat was your experience with codeup?\\nstefanie: overall, my experience was eye-opening. i did not expect to have young mothers, grandmothers, high school graduates or college graduates with masters in the same class. the culture was liberating since we were all there for the same reason – to change our paths and achieve new goals. the instructors were very hands on and helped everyone thinking about problem-solving in new ways and how to attempt developing ideas out of nothing. the hardest step was always deciding where to start and finding the confidence to dive in, code first, and prepare to work through your own problems and use the resources available. \\nlorne: codeup opened my eyes to a new world. \\xa0they made programming and something that seemed so daunting, really fun. \\xa0i never thought i would enjoy it, but the collaborative nature of it and the creative juices that got to come out, made me fall in love with it. \\xa0the instructors, the classroom, everything about it made me feel like i could do it. \\xa0i think that was the largest thing. \\xa0despite any difficulties or frustrating, i felt empowered…like given time and community, i could solve anything. \\xa0that’s an awesome feeling. \\nhow do you feel codeup has helped/is helping you grow? did/how has codeup’s career services helped you?\\nstefanie: the program taught me independence and confidence. i am more free-thinking than i have ever been. i understand how to think about everyday issues from multiple viewpoints, and i know how to stand my ground and prove my points and way of thinking. i know that it’s okay to be wrong and how to go about admitting it. even if it seems counterproductive to building independence, i know it’s okay to ask for help.the program also taught me about resourcefulness and communication on a whole new level. these two features alone were enough to land me just about any job. soft skills are just as important as the hard skills. \\nlorne: it taught me how to break down problems. \\xa0it taught me how to ask for help and that is perfectly right and ok. codeup gave me my first job, and kind of my second, as i worked for one of the founders as my second. \\xa0they always believe in their students and help them match and grow. \\n\\nany advice for current and future codeup alumni?\\nstefanie: understand that this program is meant to accelerate your learning of development. you have to be hungry for this knowledge and supplement the curriculum outside of the classroom as well as practicing it. there has to be a drive for the goal ahead. be willing to sacrifice some of your free time.this class is so much more rewarding if you learn to work as a class unit early on and help each other succeed. employers will see it in your example work, the projects and want to hear about your ability to communicate and mesh well as a developer. be open-minded and be willing to be wrong. i learned so much more from being wrong than from being right. experience is priceless in the long run.\\xa0\\nlorne: stay patient and humble. \\xa0this world of programming is huge. \\xa0it can be overwhelming. \\xa0just keep that learner mind and understand that time and keyboard time are your greatest assets. \\xa0\\xa0it may not feel like you’re growing, but then you’ll look up every now and then and realize just how much you know and how far you’ve come. \\xa0it’s a pretty awesome feeling. \\nwhat was the best part of the experience in your opinion?\\nstefanie:\\xa0the staff and fellow classmates made the program great in my eyes. the interactions and experiences of having a new community of people who had similar goals made for a welcoming and productive environment.\\nlorne: i think the greatest part is the classroom. \\xa0the idea that when everyone shares knowledge, everyone succeeds. \\xa0the collaborative power of coding is insane and if there’s anything i can attribute to the rapid rise of technology is that it brought a collective human mind to any problem. \\xa0people from all over the world now have the ability to work together to create brand new things. \\xa0you get your first taste of that in the classroom. \\xa0the sense that everyone wants you to succeed and you can lean on one another to fill in gaps where you may not be the strongest. \\xa0it’s a really amazing feeling.\\n',\n",

pretty sure i didn’t know what a bootcamp was at the time. after that, it gets less random and more codeup driven. my first job after codeup was with a company that had come to my demo day. the job after that was with a company that came to do onsite interviews at codeup. i found out about my current opportunity through codeup as well. so… three cheers (or jobs) for codeup!\\nhow do you think your past has brought you here to codeup?\\n i had taken a computer science class in high school and done well. when i was looking to transition out of the customer service/sales realm, i knew that i wanted a set of hard skills, and luckily codeup offered a place to grow those.\\nthere are a lot of options out there for learning to code. why codeup?\\xa0\\n i thought about trying to do something online, like codeacademy, but i ended up going with codeup because of the connections. where as diying your coding education is possible, it’s hard to get your resume through the door if you have no professional experience. codeup helped make initial connections that have propelled me into the career that i want. also, i am terrible at making myself watch videos online.\\nwhat got you hooked on programming or the idea of moving into the tech space?\\n i am drawn to programming because there is an answer. if your code doesn’t compile, there is a reason (and probably a silly one at that). it was a nice change of pace coming from a liberal arts background, where things are a little less black and white.\\nwhat are some things you like about codeup?\\xa0\\n definitely the snacks.\\nwhat would you change/want to see us do differently?\\n it’s hard for a coding school to do this, because it is a business, but a little more clarity upfront about the types of positions to expect (especially in a market like san antonio), would have been nice. part of the reason why i decided to do codeup was the claim that graduates made 15k more afterwards, and so i took out the loan for 15k with the idea that i could pay it back in less than a year. a month in, i realized that the average graduate salary was about 15k less than i was making, so that was a little disappointing and cause some numbers shuffling. again, i know that’s kind of a hard thing to change, but it’s the only suggestion that i have. everything else was pretty good.\\nwhat are your plans after codeup, both in the immediate and long term?\\nwell, speaking in hindsight, short term was to get paid to program and get some experience on my resume. long term is to move into a tech arch role, change the world with some awesome software and/or hardware, and become tony stark.\\na lot of people don’t think of sa as being a vibrant city for society of women engineers (swe). what have you seen in terms of the city, people, events, etc. that contradict this idea?\\xa0\\nwe’re on the comeup.\\n\\xa0i would say that san antonio has a lot of companies that have very robust swe communities that exist outside of the downtown/houston street epicenter. i think that because of the geography of san antonio (read: sprawl), it is harder to see than a place like austin or seattle.\\nwhat are some of the things minorities, disenfranchised and marginalized groups need to know about the support, or lack thereof, within codeup?\\n codeup is there to support you. practically speaking, their success is your success. aside from that, everyone there is super supportive and just generally nice. if you aren’t understanding a topic, the instructors are willing to help and walk you through it (even on their lunch break. wow!!!).\\nwhat would you say to these groups of people who are on the fence about joining a bootcamp due to lack of diversity, inclusivity, and overall fear of not having the support that they would need?\\n this is a bit tricky. i would say that first and foremost, know you’re own truth. software isn’t for everyone, so have that moment of honesty where you decide if you are doing this because you like the idea of programming every day, or because you like the idea of a 6 figure salary in 4 months and working from home everyday (spoiler alert: highly unlikely for your first, or dare i say, second programming job). if you are passionate about building software for the rest of your life, i honestly believe that codeup is the best place to start that journey. the community is incredible; the instructors are amazeballs; the staff is incredibly supportive; and the founders are boss *** hustlers. it truly is the best place to start your development journey in san antonio.

There are a lot of option out there for learning to code. Why Codeup? I thought about trying to do something online, like CodeAcademy, but I ended up going with Codeup because of the connections. Where a DIYing your coding education is possible, it’s hard to get your resume through the door if you have no professional experience. Codeup helped make initial connection that have propelled me into the career that I want. Also, I am terrible at making myself watch video online. What got you hooked on programming or the idea of moving into the tech space? I am drawn to programming because there is an answer. If your code doesn’t compile, there is a reason (and probably a silly one at that). It wa a nice change of pace coming from a liberal art background, where thing are a little le black and white. What are some thing you like about Codeup? Definitely the snacks. What would you change/want to see u do differently? It’s hard for a coding school to do this, because it is a business, but a little more clarity upfront about the type of position to expect (especially in a market like San Antonio), would have been nice. Part of the reason why I decided to do Codeup wa the claim that graduate made 15k more afterwards, and so I took out the loan for 15k with the idea that I could pay it back in le than a year. A month in, I realized that the average graduate salary wa about 15k le than I wa making, so that wa a little disappointing and cause some number shuffling. Again, I know that’s kind of a hard thing to change, but it’s the only suggestion that I have. Everything else wa pretty good. What are your plan after Codeup, both in the immediate and long term? Well, speaking in hindsight, short term wa to get paid to program and get some experience on my resume. Long term is to move into a tech arch role, change the world with some awesome software and/or hardware, and become Tony Stark. A lot of people don’t think of SA a being a vibrant city for Society of Women Engineers (SWE). What have you seen in term of the city, people, events, etc. that contradict this idea?

Program fit and quality are key to launching a successful career a a software developer, and there are six non-negotiables to keep in mind a you make your decision. 6 Tips For Picking the Best Coding Bootcamp (TL;DR) Learn from the pros. Be sure you’ll have lot of access to experienced, passionate instructors. Quality over quantity. Be wary of school with lot of campuses. You don’t want to end up at a diploma mill! In-person, not online! Schools with in-person learning environment produce better programmers. Do they put their money where their mouth is?

Keep an eye on funding options, especially those from non-profit sources. Even if you don’t qualify for a grant or scholarship, it mean the school ha been vetted by third parties. 1. Lots of 1:1 Time with Qualified, Experienced Instructors We’ve all dealt with disengaged teachers, but at a good program, you shouldn’t have to. Be sure that there’s a full staff of bona fide instructor that maximize individual attention and mutual accountability. Look for three thing in your programming instruction: actual work experience in the industry (not just at the bootcamp!), a passion for teaching, and access to one-on-one tutoring. College computer science course are heavy on theory, light on useful applications. That’s great for some folks, but a good immersive coding program give you the tool you need to get a job, and it’s best to learn from people who’ve been using them to build creation of their own. When reviewing instructors’ credentials, look past the fancy degree and give brownie point for web development job and industry savvy. With that in mind, some of the most brilliant software developer simply aren’t the greatest teachers. You want to be sure your instructor love interacting with students, explaining complex concept to beginners, and offering one-on-one help whenever needed. Also, when possible, be sure to do a campus visit and meet the instructional staff. The program staff should always be open to this. 2. Fewer Locations = Higher Quality Alright, I’ll say it. Be wary of coding school with multiple campuses. Some bootcamps are decent in one city and terrible in another. It’s much easier for a program to give you quality, individualized attention when the staff and instructor aren’t answering to people in a different time zone. There’s decade of evidence for this. The country’s best university hunker down in one spot and focus on student success. Money-hungry diploma mill have location in strip mall from coast-to-coast, some of which are known for high dropout rate and have been banned from recruiting military personnel. As with any decision in higher ed, choosing a focused coding bootcamp make all the difference. 3. Immersion You’ve probably heard people compare learning programming to learning spoken languages. There are lot of similarities, but there’s a big one to keep in mind: immersion. Both type of language are learned best through using the language all day, every day, with other people, for an extended period of time. A coding bootcamp worth your time should provide a collaborative environment that immerses you in code. You’ll be able to sharpen your new skill alongside a team of expert and vetted fellow students. Instructors push you to the next level, and when the going get tough, you can always ask one of your bright classmates—a whole group of bright classmates, in fact! 4. A Stellar Job Placement Record What’s the end game of any good coding program? Getting you a well-paid job at a company you like! First, check out the schools’s job placement rate. If their admission strategy and teaching are solid, it should be north of 90% over six months. This mean they’re accepting student who will succeed a developers, not just anyone who can pay the tuition. Next, take a look at the list of company where alumnus take jobs. Are they all funneled into one industry? What’s the ratio of startup to corporations? A diverse set of post-grad placement suggests you’ll learn the programming skill necessary to succeed in any work environment. Also, make sure the school is willing to put it money where it mouth is. Good program should guarantee you a job in a timely fashion or else give you a significant refund. Would you rather start something of your own? Even better! Keep reading below. 5. Ecosystem, Ecosystem, Ecosystem The tech industry thrives in area where entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and developers—i.e., you!—can easily get together and make the magic happen. Collaborative workspaces, like Geekdom in San Antonio, allow entrepreneur to build new business and product together. Notable local tech company like Rackspace and top-tier startup accelerator are also key indicator of a healthy ecosystem and provide important funding source for new ventures. Cities with diverse, technology-heavy industry (e.g., healthcare, military, energy, aeronautics, automotive, and advanced manufacturing) also offer a strong commercial base to support tech entrepreneur and job seekers. As you start to build things, it’s also nice to be in a somewhat smaller ecosystem. Getting in on the ground floor of a growing tech scene give you access to willing and able mentors. Smaller tech city also tend to have lower cost of living. A new software engineer often find it helpful to be a big fish in a friendly, easy-to-navigate pond, where the tech community’s got her back in time of success and failure. 6. Ample Funding Options Keep an eye out for school with various funding options. Many offer loan that allow student to defer payment until after graduation. That’s a huge plus, but you should also ask about non-profit tuition grant and scholarships. And should you not qualify for these benefits, at least you can rest assured that third party have vetted your school and it leadership is serious increasing access to education. So…which coding bootcamp is right for you? Immersive coding program can get you started on an exciting new career path. That said, big life transition aren’t easy. It’s important to find the right program, and we encourage all applicant to vet their option for how well each school teach and accommodates their students.

Kevin Kopas, Channel Manager for Radix Registry, stopped by the Codeup classroom to help student better understand the gTLD program and how it may transform the domain industry over the next few years. What is a domain, anyway? Domains are identifier that create space of authority within the internet. A domain reflects an Internet Protocol address (IP address), which link to the server where a website is hosted. Domains are organized according to a hierarchical model consisting of top-level, second-level, and lower-level domains. Top-level domain (TLDs) constitute the highest level of domain in the DNS. There are many type of TLDs–including country code like .us, .uk, and .jp–and Generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs), such a .com, .info, .edu, and .org. gTLDs are operated and managed by registries, like Radix. Second and lower-level domain directly follow TLDs and are located to the left of the “.” in a domain. For a visual, in the domain “codeup20.wpengine.com,” “.com” is the gTLD and “codeup” is the second-level domain. Typically, registry delegate the responsibility of allotting domain name to registrars, such a GoDaddy. How is the domain industry changing? Until recently, the list of gTLDs wa limited to traditional strings, like the previously-mentioned .com and .net, a well a .gov, .mil, .org. and .edu. Over the years, the number of desirable and available second and third-level domain associated with these gTLDs ha become increasingly scarce. To diversify the pool of available domains, ICANN is in the process of introducing 1300+ new gTLDs. These include everything from .baby, .mls, .dot, and .realty, to .sucks, and .buy. Radix ha acquired eight new gTLDs, including .space, and .website, and will soon be offering .tech. Registries can apply for a new gTLD through ICANN. In the case that multiple registry apply for the same gTLD, those company partake in an auction to determine the winner. ICANN run it own auction to solve these contention sets; however, company have found way to resolve these dispute before reaching ICANN through private auction like Applicant Auction, which have their own rule and regulations. Sometimes company even negotiate deal on their own instead of conducting a private auction. The winning price for each gTLD varies.

For example, on the low end of the March 2015 ICANN auction , .srl wa purchased for $400,000; on the high end, Google purchased .app for $25 million. What doe this mean for the web? In Kopas’ opinion, slowly but surely, the .coms and .nets of the world will become overpowered by more specific gTLDs. While the impending end of the .com era may be sad for some, this shift also open up new opportunity for creativity and specificity in a company’s branding and marketing. With a more diverse list of available gTLDS, company can better align their web presence with their product or services: a beauty salon could use .salon or an independent realtor could use .realtor.

       "  'category': '\\xa0in general, uncategorized',\n",
       "  'original': '\\nwhat is the value of a codeup education?\\nthis is a guest article\\xa0by michael taylor, originally posted at the rivard report\\xa0and bankers anonymous.\\n\\xa0\\nlike many, i see education from a combination of angles. unquestionably, education makes us broader thinkers and more sparkling conversationalists. education makes us more actualized humans.\\nbut as a finance guy, a small evil part of me always applies the $64,000 wall street question to every activity – from brushing my teeth to tossing a ball with a (in my case, non-existent) dog. [1] it’s the bottom-line question: “how is this making me money, like, right now?” [2]\\none of the problems of education, generally, is that we have a hard time proving or quantifying its value. what is the value of holding your shoulders back and head high when you walk into a job interview, knowing you’re the best they’re going to interview that week? or the value of the feeling, when given a work assignment, of “boom! i got this!”\\nphilosophically, how can you put a value on just knowing more stuff?\\ncodeup\\nthe weird thing about my friend michael girdley – who started the computer coding school\\xa0codeup – is that he’s ambitious enough to say that the education community tradition of waving a hand at hard-to-measure fuzzy feelings is not good enough. just because the education community finds it difficult to measure value doesn’t mean that business people shouldn’t try.\\nin less than two years he’s established a pattern of tracking data on the most important finance question of education.\\xa0by that, i mean the bottom-line question: how is this making me money, like, right now?\\xa0girdley shared with me the pre-codeup and post-codeup earnings of his students, along with some useful stats on entry-level and mid-career web developer salaries.\\nusing a couple of his statistics, i want to take a stab at figuring out the total value, right now, of a student’s investment in codeup.\\nstatistic #1:\\n“the average codeup graduate saw her annual salary jump $13,035 in the year after graduation from the program.”\\nwhat does that really mean? what can you do with that number if you plan, say, 30 working years at this higher salary?\\nit would be great to say that a codeup education is worth 30 times $13,035, or $391,050. however, money in the future is not as valuable to me as money today, so that calculation is not quite accurate.\\xa0i mean, you could figure it, but finance guys will give you the\\xa0time value of money\\xa0speech that you don’t want to hear again.\\nwith a salary increase of just $13,035, we can\\xa0calculate\\xa0what that amount is worth today by using a\\xa0discounted cashflow formula. so let’s be sophisticated and apply our discounted cashflow formula to 30 years of earnings, elevated by $13,035.\\ni have to assume a “discount rate,” which is some combination of taking into account inflation and future investment risks. i’m going to assume a 5% discount rate.

[1] it’ the bottom-lin question: “how is thi make me money, like, right now?” [2] one of the problem of education, generally, is that we have a hard time prove or quantifi it value. what is the valu of hold your shoulder back and head high when you walk into a job interview, know you’r the best they’r go to interview that week? Or the valu of the feeling, when given a work assignment, of “boom! I got this!” philosophically, how can you put a valu on just know more stuff? codeup the weird thing about my friend michael girdley – who start the comput code school codeup – is that he’ ambiti enough to say that the educ commun tradit of wave a hand at hard-to-measur fuzzi feel is not good enough. just becaus the educ commun find it difficult to measur valu doesn’t mean that busi peopl shouldn’t try. In less than two year he’ establish a pattern of track data on the most import financ question of education. By that, I mean the bottom-lin question: how is thi make me money, like, right now? girdley share with me the pre-codeup and post-codeup earn of hi students, along with some use stat on entry-level and mid-car web develop salaries. use a coupl of hi statistics, I want to take a stab at figur out the total value, right now, of a student’ invest in codeup. statist #1: “the averag codeup graduat saw her annual salari jump $13,035 in the year after graduat from the program.” what doe that realli mean? what can you do with that number if you plan, say, 30 work year at thi higher salary? It would be great to say that a codeup educ is worth 30 time $13,035, or $391,050. however, money in the futur is not as valuabl to me as money today, so that calcul is not quit accurate. I mean, you could figur it, but financ guy will give you the time valu of money speech that you don’t want to hear again. with a salari increas of just $13,035, we can calcul what that amount is worth today by use a discount cashflow formula. So let’ be sophist and appli our discount cashflow formula to 30 year of earnings, elev by $13,035. I have to assum a “discount rate,” which is some combin of take into account inflat and futur invest risks. i’m go to assum a 5% discount rate. [3] use my 5% discount rate, I estim the valu today of my elev salari to be $200,379.90. that’ the sum of 30 years’ worth of $13,035, but “discounted,” or translat back, into today’ dollars. that discount allow us to more accur compar the $16,000 tuition for codeup with the total financi value, today, of that education. By that measure, you pay codeup $16k today for someth worth on average, $200k, today. [4] anoth way of put it is that you are buy someth today worth 12.5 time that amount. with these numbers, codeup sound like pretti good deal. statist #2: “the averag web developer, nationally, earn $91,750. that’ $61,525 more than the averag pre-codeup salari of survey codeup students.” So that’ interesting. We can imagin a number of reason for thi differ which don’t have to do with the valu of codeup. mayb the averag web develop is older and more experienc on the job than the averag pre-codeup student. mayb nation salari are higher than san antonio salaries, on average. I mean, i’m sure they are. but still. If one of your goal is to swim in a higher-paid talent pool, it might pay to learn the butterfli stroke. how much would 15 peak year of earn $61,525 more than you earn now be worth, like, right now? again, I don’t think it’ as high as 15 time $61,525, or $922,875, becaus of the whole discount cashflow of money in the futur not be worth as much money today. also, to be fair, you probabl won’t earn the averag nation salari until you had a few year to ramp up your career. but what about discount 15 year of an addit $61,525 per year, at a 5% rate, start 5 year from now, use the exact same formula that we use before?

Is that someth you might be interest in?” look, seriously, there are a lot of assumpt embed in my statement that “you could pay $16k in tuition today for futur salari jump worth $500k, today.” most import of these is the assumpt that, by train as a programmer, you can earn the nation averag salari for program jobs. and we all know there’ no guarante that happens. but – and thi is a big but [6] – it’ not a crazi assumption. because, really, it’ an assumpt that the averag happens. it’ an assumpt that you could be paid what other peopl in your industri are gener paid. it’ an assumpt that market are somewhat efficient. it’ an assumpt that, if you have valuabl skills, you can find employ and work situat just like other people. all of which make me pretti confid that the financi return on a skill upgrad like codeup can be somewher between 12 and 31 time the upfront tuition cost. back TO the valu OF AN educ As I said before, educ lead to more sparkl convers as well as to a more fulli actual life. Of that, I have no doubt. but I appreci my friend girdley’ business-lik approach to show that the valu of hi program can be somewher between a 12 and 31 time multipl of your investment. just think like a financ guy, is that someth you might be interest in? ——– [1] notic I haven’t gotten a dog becaus – I ask you – where’ the profit in that?

If you don’t like my 5% assumption, make your own, I can’t promis you i’m “right” about a 5% discount rate. you might be just as right with a differ assumption. also, rememb the faux philosoph and nativ san antonian jack handey is a good guid to these disagreements: “instead of have ‘answers’ on a math test, they should just call them ‘impressions,’ and if you got a differ ‘impression,’ so what, can’t we all be brothers?” [4] In addit to the $16k tuition of cours you have to do a lot of work to not onli learn to code, but also, you know, earn a salari in the future. So there’ still that whole ‘work’ problem. but if you have to work, it’ nice for the financ part to at least make sense, no? [5] whi did I choos 15 year and not 30 thi time? mostli becaus I don’t think it’ fair to assum a codeup graduate’ salari jump immedi to the averag nation salary. you work up to that. for that same reason, I calcul the valu with a 5 year delay, to account for a slow ramp-up. again, jack handey come to mind: “if you ever teach a yodel class, probabl the hardest thing is to keep the student from just tri to yodel right off. you see, we build to that.” [6] hhhnn-huh. heh.

       "  'lemmatized': 'What is the Value of a Codeup Education? This is a guest article by Michael Taylor, originally posted at The Rivard Report and Bankers Anonymous. Like many, I see education from a combination of angles. Unquestionably, education make u broader thinker and more sparkling conversationalists. Education make u more actualized humans. But a a finance guy, a small evil part of me always applies the $64,000 Wall Street question to every activity – from brushing my teeth to tossing a ball with a (in my case, non-existent) dog. [1] It’s the bottom-line question: “How is this making me money, like, right now?” [2] One of the problem of education, generally, is that we have a hard time proving or quantifying it value. What is the value of holding your shoulder back and head high when you walk into a job interview, knowing you’re the best they’re going to interview that week? Or the value of the feeling, when given a work assignment, of “Boom! I got this!” Philosophically, how can you put a value on just knowing more stuff? CODEUP The weird thing about my friend Michael Girdley – who started the computer coding school Codeup – is that he’s ambitious enough to say that the education community tradition of waving a hand at hard-to-measure fuzzy feeling is not good enough. Just because the education community find it difficult to measure value doesn’t mean that business people shouldn’t try. In le than two year he’s established a pattern of tracking data on the most important finance question of education. By that, I mean the bottom-line question: How is this making me money, like, right now? Girdley shared with me the pre-Codeup and post-Codeup earnings of his students, along with some useful stats on entry-level and mid-career web developer salaries. Using a couple of his statistics, I want to take a stab at figuring out the total value, right now, of a student’s investment in Codeup. STATISTIC #1: “The average Codeup graduate saw her annual salary jump $13,035 in the year after graduation from the program.” What doe that really mean? What can you do with that number if you plan, say, 30 working year at this higher salary? It would be great to say that a Codeup education is worth 30 time $13,035, or $391,050. However, money in the future is not a valuable to me a money today, so that calculation is not quite accurate. I mean, you could figure it, but finance guy will give you the time value of money speech that you don’t want to hear again. With a salary increase of just $13,035, we can calculate what that amount is worth today by using a discounted cashflow formula. So let’s be sophisticated and apply our discounted cashflow formula to 30 year of earnings, elevated by $13,035. I have to assume a “discount rate,” which is some combination of taking into account inflation and future investment risks. I’m going to assume a 5% discount rate. [3] Using my 5% discount rate, I estimate the value today of my elevated salary to be $200,379.90. That’s the sum of 30 years’ worth of $13,035, but “discounted,” or translated back, into today’s dollars. That discounting allows u to more accurately compare the $16,000 tuition for Codeup with the total financial value, today, of that education. By that measure, you pay Codeup $16K today for something worth on average, $200K, today. [4] Another way of putting it is that you are buying something today worth 12.5 time that amount. With these numbers, Codeup sound like pretty good deal. STATISTIC #2: “The average web developer, nationally, earns $91,750. That’s $61,525 more than the average pre-Codeup salary of surveyed Codeup students.” So that’s interesting. We can imagine a number of reason for this difference which don’t have to do with the value of Codeup. Maybe the average web developer is older and more experienced on the job than the average pre-Codeup student. Maybe national salary are higher than San Antonio salaries, on average. I mean, I’m sure they are. But still. If one of your goal is to swim in a higher-paid talent pool, it might pay to learn the butterfly stroke. How much would 15 peak year of earning $61,525 more than you earn now be worth, like, right now? Again, I don’t think it’s a high a 15 time $61,525, or $922,875, because of the whole discounted cashflow of money in the future not being worth a much money today. Also, to be fair, you probably won’t earn the average national salary until you had a few year to ramp up your career. But what about discounting 15 year of an additional $61,525 per year, at a 5% rate, starting 5 year from now, using the exact same formula that we used before? [5] Discounting those 15 year of earning the average industry salary give me a value, today, of $500,366.44. Which, to state the obvious, is 31X the price of tuition. With those kind of number I start to feel like that sale guy from Entourage: “What if I wa to tell you that you’d pay $16,000 tuition to Codeup for something worth $500K today? Is that something you might be interested in?” Look, seriously, there are a lot of assumption embedded in my statement that “you could pay $16K in tuition today for future salary jump worth $500K, today.” Most important of these is the assumption that, by training a a programmer, you can earn the national average salary for programming jobs. And we all know there’s no guarantee that happens. But – and this is a big but [6] – it’s not a crazy assumption. Because, really, it’s an assumption that the average happens. It’s an assumption that you could be paid what other people in your industry are generally paid. It’s an assumption that market are somewhat efficient. It’s an assumption that, if you have valuable skills, you can find employer and work situation just like other people. All of which make me pretty confident that the financial return on a skill upgrade like Codeup can be somewhere between 12 and 31 time the upfront tuition cost. BACK TO THE VALUE OF AN EDUCATION As I said before, education lead to more sparkling conversation a well a to a more fully actualized life. Of that, I have no doubt. But I appreciate my friend Girdley’s business-like approach to showing that the value of his program can be somewhere between a 12 and 31 time multiple of your investment. Just thinking like a finance guy, is that something you might be interested in? ——– [1] Notice I haven’t gotten a dog because – I ask you – where’s the profit in that? [2] I’m still working on monetizing my teeth-brushing. [3] How did I come up with 5%? Sorta kinda I used art in addition to science.
